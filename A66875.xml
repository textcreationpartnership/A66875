            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eſides the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all theſe Paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventures, Thoſe who ſuppoſe they can do much better; and ſuch who are not pleaſed they have not done ſo well: from a twofold ſort of Men I expect a ſevere reflection upon this undertaking; chiefly from thoſe who make it their buſineſs to reject all Religion in groſs as a thing no where Exiſting but in the Minds of ſequacious and fearful Men, and deride all attempts made towards its rational juſtification:
<pb facs="tcp:63973:5"/>And alſo from them, who ſuppoſe things of this nature, priviledged from all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute or debate, things not to be proved but admitted, that all endeavours of this kind, are but an open arraignment of ſuch Fundamentals as ought not to be question'd, a diſſervice done to the cauſe of Religion thereby, and at beſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but uſeleſs and impertinent.</p>
            <p>The following diſcourſe (My Lord,) as it is in its nature no way condited to the guſt of any ſuch men on either hand; ſo I muſt needs acknowledge my ſelf to be best pleaſed with whatever is leaſt ſo: The firſt are an abſurd Generation, that by an empty prophane ſort of diſcourſe, which themſelves call Wit, would fain <hi>Hector</hi> us out of the wiſeſt and beſt part of the world, make that the ſcorn of this Age, which hath been the moſt valu'd and moſt reverene'd in all others; And whenever reduced to any ſober and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal conteſt, have no other relief from
<pb facs="tcp:63973:5"/>the ſhame of their own folly, then what they find in thoſe naked ſhelters of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and confidence: Irreligion 'tis true in its practice hath been ſtill the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of every Age, but its open and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick defence ſeems the peculiar of this; 'Tis but of late that men come to defend ill living, and ſecure themſelves againſt their own guilt, by an open defyance to all the great maxims of Piety and Virtue; 'Tis but of late the world hath been told, <hi>That the notion of a Spirit implies a contradiction; That the Bible is no where in force as a Law Divine, but where by Laws civil and municipal 'tis made ſo to be; That Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a fear of inviſible powers feign'd in the Mind, and fancyed from tales publickly allowed;</hi> Theſe and moſt of the bad Principles of this Age are of no earlier a date then one very ill Book, are indeed but the ſpawn of the <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than:</hi> The other are a ſort of eaſie and
<pb facs="tcp:63973:6"/>credulous men, that derive their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion no higher then Education &amp; Cuſtom, have taken up their greateſt concerns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt, and whenſoever encounter'd but by any ſmall artificer in the Scepticks, are ſure to be ſufficiently baffled, Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Religion expoſed to the utmoſt contempt; And upon all ſuch attack's, they either go off wounded with a ſecret diſlike of their own Profeſſion, or oblige themſelves to a ſtubborn and bruitiſh ſort of drudgery, to believe that for which they find they are able to give no good reaſon: Would ſuch dull men once be at leiſure from doing nothing; would they once be perſuaded to make but a ſalley in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the exerciſe of their own Reaſon, 'twere no hard task to convince them, that nothing proves more fatal to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of Religion, then this ſtupid ſort of credulity; 'Tis from hence, and from that weak impotent defenſe of the moſt eminent Truths, that reſults natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb facs="tcp:63973:6"/>from it, that Mens prophane Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs have been chiefly erected; 'Tis from hence that we hear of ſo many, ſo eaſily, and ſo often ſeduced; And 'tis thoſe Ages when Men fell off and retir'd from the rational proof of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſunk into implicite Belief, and ignorant Devotion, from whence we may date moſt of the great ills of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superſtition, and from whence all thoſe devout fooleries, which have ſince ſo cumber'd the world, had their chiefeſt and firſt riſe: As the whole of Religion is declared to be a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Service, and can be no other, ſo all the Principles of it in order to its ſo being, muſt upon rational grounds ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be eſtabliſh'd, what ever Belief is built upon the credit of any Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ought to be ultimately reſolved into a rational proof of that Revelation as ſuch, and what ever appears to us upon thoſe terms ſo to be, whatever can be
<pb facs="tcp:63973:7"/>ſufficiently proved to be revealed to us from God, from the Soveraign Power of its Author, puts in but a reaſonable claim to our aſſent, though the matter of it in ſome things exceed the bounds of a humane capacity; And herein it is the <hi>Socinians</hi> (who had they confin'd themſelves to a rational proof that all we believe is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, had been of very good uſe to the Church) have greatly miſcarryed, and when they would need ſubject all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t ought to be given to all that God reveals, fell foul upon thoſe two Fundamentals of our Religion, <hi>the Union of the two Natures, and that of the Trinity,</hi> and indeed have come much ſhort of that Reverence all Nations have paid to their Gods, who by all their Mysteries ſtill have profeſſed to believe ſome things upon the ſcore of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Credit, which by their own Reaſon they could not fully comprehend.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:63973:7"/>
            <p>Were not the looſe Principles, <hi>My Lord,</hi> of this degenerate Age, about the moſt Eſſential parts of Religion, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than a ſufficient <hi>Apology,</hi> for whatever is done this way; yet me thinks we can never inculcate too much, even unto the <hi>beſt</hi> men upon this Subject, and that upon theſe two Grounds; <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe 'tis from this Book, we derive all the certain notions we have of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a farther World, and the great account of all inviſible things; and Secondly becauſe 'tis the higheſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive we have to all good living; 'tis from hence, from the authority of this Book, that we are chiefly obliged to all that is holy and good, and engaged againſt all the corrupt prastiſes of humane Life, when we conſider with what difficulty we attain in the firſt Caſe to a fixed and unſhaken belief of ſuch things as we do not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſee, and how apt we are in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to decline from the ſtrict Rules
<pb facs="tcp:63973:8"/>of a good life, nothing can ſeem more neceſſary then a rational inſurance about the great Foundation of all Belief and Practice in both.</p>
            <p>That with a perfect ſecurity to our preſent and future welfare, we may rely upon this Book, as that great and only Revelation, by which God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, rule, and judge the world; I have hereby attempted to make evident, not only from its own excellent nature and compoſure, and ſuch viſible and open effects of a ſupreme and almighty power as accompanyed its firſt Publication, and laſted till the Church was ſo far built, that the Scaffolding might be ſafely taken down; but alſo from many other conſiderations, from whence an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant teſtimony to its Divinity will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to reſult: And this task if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently perform'd as 'twill give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all reaſonable doubts, and caſt a juſt contempt upon all prophane reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
<pb facs="tcp:63973:8"/>ſo it will alſo reflect much upon thoſe,, who though they acknowledge this Book to come from God, yet not acquieſſing ſingly in the conduct thereof, declare it thereby inſufficient to thoſe great ends for which it appears to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and ſuch are thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> on the one hand, and all ſorts of <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> on the other, who by a twofold ſuperfoetation, that of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Traditions, and that of new and continued Revelations, have rendred the whole Scriptures, if not uſeleſs, Yet as to their great end and deſign, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deficient and imperfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I ſeek not by this Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to countenance a defence of the Bible, nor any way to ſecure my ſelf againſt the just reproach of an ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; the firſt would engage me in an open affront to a <hi>Chriſtian State;</hi> and the other oblige me to be too injurious to You, and that Candor and love to
<pb facs="tcp:63973:9"/>Truth you poſſeſs; 'Tis alone that great Honour, and that entire affection I have for Your Lordſhip, that Intereſts Your Name in this matter, though there is nothing leſs needed by You than diſcourſes of this nature, Yet there is nothing more due from me, then an open and publick profeſſion that my ſelf, and what ever I do, is devoted to Your Service.

In ſuch a caſe, there can be no Middle-way, but either we muſt receive this Book and ſubmit to it as ſuch, or elſe reject it with the juſteſt contempt imaginable. It is in nothing to be credited, if it be not in Truth what it pretends to be.

This being admitted (which it ought to be) that no man can, with any good Reaſon, cloſe with the Chriſtian Religion, and at the ſame time Renounce the <hi>Bible.</hi> That Maxime of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> being undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that <hi>Contra Scripturas nemo Chriſtianus.</hi> There are but three ſorts of men by whom the Scriptures can, at any time, be generally Attact, and from whoſe principles their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Authority can receive an Univerſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion.

Secondly, Such who admit the Being of God, and a ſupreme and firſt cauſe, but deny his providence, and believe he is no way concer'd about the World, nor troubles himſelf to exerciſe any Rule or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63973:13"/>at all over it. Thirdly, Such who admit the Being of God, and the exiſtence of Religion, and providence, but reject the Chriſtian Religion, as not True, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſome other in oppoſition to it.</p>
            <p>Of thoſe firſt-born Monſters of Mankind, that <hi>Anomalous</hi> off-ſpring who deny the Being of God, whoſe principles contain in them the utmoſt dreggs of all humane Apoſtacy, and are of all others, the moſt wild and abſurd, for, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayes, <hi>Deos eſſe, ita perſpicuum eſt, ut is qui negat, vix eum ſanae mentis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtimem. The Being of the Gods is ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that no man can be thought well in his wits that denies it.</hi> A previous conſideration is neceſſary to whatever is ſaid upon this or any other Divine ſubject; and therefore I have already conteſted with ſuch, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatcht all my concernes with them, in order to this matter, and the laſt converſe I mean to have with that evil generation, of whom it may moſt truely be ſaid, They are not only the avowed oppoſers of all Religion, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are <hi>Hoſtes Humani generis, The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies of all mankind:</hi> Who, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying a Supreme Being above, demoliſh the great ſupport of all well-being here below.

            </p>
            <p>For thoſe ſecundary Enemies to the <hi>Bible,</hi> and together with that of all Religion, ſuch who admit the Being of God, but deny all Providence, and Divine Rule over the World; ſuch who out of ſhame, diſown the grand principle of Atheiſm, but yet, by this Method, ſecure all the effects of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Of thoſe a preliminary conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on ought to be had. A previous confutation of ſuch principles, being of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make way for the diſcourſe in hand. For it muſt needs be a vain and impracticable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to indeavour to prove any Book to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and a Law given forth from God, if there be no ſuch Law any where in Being; which we are ſure there never can be, if God no way concernes himſelf with what men do, nor exerciſes any Dominion at all over them?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63973:14"/>'Tis plain, ſuch principles do, <hi>uno ictu,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch all Religion out of the World, put a perfect period to all Divinity, and render it a thing very abſurd, to ſubmit either in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or practice to any thing as Divine. To this purpoſe <hi>Cicero</hi> concludes in his firſt Book <hi>De nat. Deor. Sin autem Dii</hi> (ſays he) <hi>neque poſſunt nos juvare, nec volunt, nec curant om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino, nec quid agamus animadvertunt, nec eſt quod ab his ad hominum vitam permanare poſsit, Quid eſt quod ullos Diis immortalibus Cultus, Honores, Praeces, adhibeamus?</hi> If the Gods be no way concern'd about us, to what end ſhould we worſhip or ſerve them? And <hi>Cotta</hi> in the ſame book tells <hi>Velleius,</hi> That <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> by making God careleſs of the affairs of men, <hi>Suſtulerit omnem funditus Religionem:</hi> Has utterly ſubverted all Religion. <hi>Quid eſt enim cur Deos ab hominibus colendos dicas, cum Dii non modo hominibus non conſulant, ſed om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino nihil curent, nihil agant?</hi> The ſame <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr</hi> obſerved in the beginning of his Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon,</hi> ſpeaking to him of the opinion of thoſe Philoſophers who deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of Providence. Says he, <hi>Hoc vero ad quem illi referant finem intelligere diſicile non eſt; Nam hoc efficit ſecuritas atque libertas loquendi, &amp; eos qui haec docent ſectandi, &amp; quod volunt agendi, &amp; dicendi impunitas.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63973:15"/>Neque paenam aliam metuens, neque bonum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſperans a Deo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That men by a denyal of Providence, do only publiſh another Edition of Atheiſm is evident enough. 'Tis in it ſelf equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all Virtue and Religion, and lies in no leſs oppoſition to all true reaſoning, to ſay the higheſt Being no way concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with what men do here below, as to ſay there is no ſuch Being at all. That there is ſuch a being, and that this Being is a puniſher of evil doers, and a Rewarder of them that do well, is the great Topick from whence all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all good Manners are derived. If God regard not what Men do, they are no more obliged in their actions then if there were no God at all: And 'tis not more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to deny that God Is, then to admit him to be, and then deny thoſe things that muſt neceſſarily belong to ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>
            <p>That the fixed belief of Gods Rule over the world accompanied the notion of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, amongſt the beſt and wiſeſt of the Heathen, will appear obvious, if we conſult the writings of <hi>Seneca, Plutarch, Epictetus, Simplitius,</hi> and many others of them. <hi>Balbus</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi> thus begins his Speech. <hi>Omnino dividunt noſtri totam iſtam de Diis immortalibus queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63973:15"/>in partes quatour. Primum docent eſſe Deos, deinde quales ſint, tum Mundum ab his Adminiſtrari, poſtremo eos conſulere rebus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis. Thoſe of our opinion always divide the queſtion about the Gods into four parts; Firſt, we teach that the Gods are: Then how they exiſt! Then, that the World is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by them: And laſtly, that they take the care of humane affairs.</hi> And <hi>Tully</hi> in his ſecond Book <hi>de Legib.</hi> tells us, <hi>Perſuaſum hoc ſit a principio hominibus Dominos eſſe om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium rerum ac moderatores Deos, ea<expan>

Men have believed this from the beginning that the Gods governed the World, and that all things were under their Dominion and Rule. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> who firſt aſſaulted the Doctrine of Providence, and by a denyal of that found a way to transform the notion of God, ſo far as it concerns men, into a meer nullity, would needs ſuppoſe it a thing below the greatneſs of God to take any notice of humane affairs, or concern himſelf with what men did here.

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63973:16"/>that the Bleſſed and Immortal Being had no imployment himſelf, nor occaſioned any trouble to others, which appeared a thing ſo abſurd in it ſelf, and ſo Heterodox to all true Philoſophy, that the beſt Moraliſts ſharply rebuked his folly, thought this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his to be <hi>Turpis &amp; indigna,</hi> baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and refuſed him the Honour to be ſtiled a Philoſopher, who would be ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuppoſe that ſloth and ſtupidity in the Deity, which every worthy and good man thought beneath himſelf. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (though no very good Divine, nor very Orthodox aſſerter of Providence, yet) ſo loathed this abſurd fiction of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and a total denial of Providence, that he ſpeaks of it with this keen reflection: ſayes he, Diverſity of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions requires diverſity of anſwers; Some ask whether Fire be hot! Theſe muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by being made to touch it. Some ask whether their Parents are to be honoured! Theſe are not to be diſcourſed with but rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Others ask whether there be any Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that Rules the world, and refuſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it without apparent demonſtrations! Such men (ſayes he) ſhould be anſwered by a Whip, rather than by a Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>How extreme unreaſonable the denial of Providence and Gods univerſal Rule over the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63973:16"/>world is, how unſuitable and oppoſite to thoſe conceptions of him our own Reaſons dictate to us! will ſoon appear, if we view over thoſe fond ſpeculations men have pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with about this matter.</p>
            <p>Some have confined providence to the Heavens, and limited it to what is above us. Will needs Imagine that God regards nothing beyond the Sphere of the Heavens, and that his Dominion reacheth no farther then the Heavenly Bodies; thoſe they acknowledge, are under a Divine diſpoſure. God ſettles (they grant) the Stars in their courſes, and orders all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Coeleſtial Bodies; but has no concern at all for any thing here below, nor regards what happens on this ſide the Clouds. This folly is ſufficiently confuted, when we conſider how evident it is that the Motions and Influences of the Heavens are all deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the uſe and benefit of Mankind, and the good of all ſublunary things, and are ſtill guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a conſtant and ſuitable tendency therunto. Now, how unreaſonable is it to ſuppoſe, That God ſhould provide and diſpoſe means in order to an end, and yet have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the end it ſelf! That God ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Heavens in order to the good of this lower world, and yet be no way at all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about it!

            <p>Others have Imagined that Providence is exerciſed about Univerſals, but not about Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars; that God takes care of Generals, but nor of particulars.

The Species of Mankind ſubſiſts in the Individuals and Particulars, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under it: And therefore God cannot be ſaid to take care of Mankind, nor his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to extend to it in general, unleſs it do ſo in particulars, and his care reach to every Individual man. Abſtract the Genus of any ſort of Creatures from the Species and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, of which it neceſſarily conſiſts, and 'tis

            </p>
            <p>A third ſort there have been, that will have Divine Providence reach no farther then Men that ſay, 'tis converſant, <hi>circa Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, non circa Beſtias,</hi> that God deſcends not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63973:18"/>to the care of other Creatures beneath man, nor buſies himſelf with thoſe inferiour parts of the world. This Doctrine ſeems to have been firſt ſet on foot by ſome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from whom 'tis probable <hi>Pythagoras</hi> learnt it, and became the teacher of it in <hi>Graece;</hi> for ſo we find it in <hi>Hierocles.</hi> And it has been too much countenanced ſince by St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> in in his Expoſition of the Propheſie of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God by his Providence, after a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner, Rules over the ſeveral parts of the world, and guids and diſpoſes them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Nature of their Beings, and that proper end to which he firſt deſigned them, is not to be denied. But that any parts of the world (thoſe beings beneath the nature of Man) are not under the conduct of Providence, is a poſition evidently untrue; for if we conſider Providence as it relates to preſervation, the intire Fabrick of the world, in the whole of it, cannot be continued without a preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every part. If we conſider Providence as it relates to Rule and Dominion, there can be nothing more plain, then that all Irrational Creatures are ſo under the Sovereignty and Dominion of Providence; becauſe they are all guided in whatſoever they do to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular end, and all in general to one common
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63973:18"/>End. Now to move or act towards ſome end, is the peculiar property of an intelligent Being. And therefore when we ſee Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures void of Intelligence, conſtantly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly moving and acting toward ſome end, and all to a common end: 'Tis plain they are guided by ſome ſuperiour Intelligence that has a ſupreme conduct of their Being; which can be no other then that we call God in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            <p>But the grand and total ſubverter of the Doctrine of Providence is <hi>Epicurus,</hi> with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius, Pliny,</hi> and others that have in this point embraced his ſentiments. They whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny all Providence whatſoever: Suppoſe it a thing beneath the ſupreme Being to take any notice of humane affairs; Imagine the world wholy left to it ſelf, and that God is retired above, having not the leaſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf, nor at all regarding what others do.</p>
            <p>To what juſt contempt, and to how pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable a confutation <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his followers, and all deniers of Providence, expoſe themſelves by the vanity and folly of ſuch an opinion, will, with great eaſe, be made to appear to every impartial underſtanding. If God exerciſe no Dominion over the world, nor take any care of its preſervation, if there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63973:19"/>be no ſuch thing as Providence in either kind, it muſt either be becauſe he cannot, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not. To ſay the firſt, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what men ſay before, when they admit (which the <hi>Epicureans</hi> do) the exiſtence of an Infinite Being. 'Tis a groſs contradiction to ſay God cannot rule the world, and yet to ſay he is Infinite. (And 'tis plain, Infiniteneſs is inſeperably annexed to his Being) If there be ſuch a being that was before all, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above all, there can be no reaſonable doubt of his power and ability, to rule and command all, and where ever his making and firſt framing of all is acknowledged there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any; for there can be no ſubjection in it ſelf ſo natural and ſo neceſſary as in what is made, to him that made it; nor any Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo abſolute or ſo certain as in the firſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of all things. To ſay that God cannot Rule the world, is, in effect, to ſay, there is no God that made the world: for the admiſſion of the one, naturally infers the poſſibility of the other. 'Tis much eaſier to ſuppoſe Gods Dominion over it now, then his Creation of it at firſt; and he that denyes a poſſibility of the former, can upon no good ground ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the latter. Secondly, to ſay that God will not, that is, though he could Rule and order the world, yet out of choiſe he refuſeth do it,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63973:19"/>and hath deſignedly withdrawn him ſelf from all the concerns of it, is an affirmation highly unreaſonable; and that upon many accounts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This is plainly to ſuppoſe (if we admit Creation) that God made the world to no purpoſe at all, beyond its bare exiſtence, and without any deſigned end to himſelf by it, future to its ſimple Being: for Providence is nothing but the preſerving and guiding of all things exiſting, to a common end. 'Tis to ſuppoſe a world capable of many noble and excellent ends, when made, without propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any end at all to himſelf by it. The meaneſt Compoſers in the ſmalleſt matters are never guilty of ſuch an abſurdity! 'Twere ſtrange to Imagine the higheſt Wiſdom, and the perfection of it ſhould (in that act of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World) fall beneath the exerciſe of every common diſcretion. No man attempts any thing without a proſpect of ſome end: If God have layed by all thoughts of the world, and concerns himſelf no more about it then as if no ſuch thing as the World were at all in being (which by the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Doctrine he does) What end can we conceive God to have in the firſt making of it? Nay, 'tis not only unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that God infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſe, ſhould make the World without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing any end, but without propoſing the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63973:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>higheſt and utmoſt end to himſelf the World is capable of. If any man ſay, that God in making the World, had no other end but the making of it, and that the bare act of making it was his end; he ſayes that which is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſurd, and that upon theſe two Grounds. Firſt, The bare act of Gods making the World could never be his end; becauſe the World it ſelf, when made, barely conſidered, only as made, and in his ſimple exiſtence could not be his end; and if ſo, then the act of making it could not be his end, becauſe all the rational End of making muſt lie in the Thing made. Whoever makes, without reſpect to the thing made by him, makes without reſpect to the true End of making, which cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the workmanſhip of God. Now; that the ſimple being of the World (abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly conſidered from all uſe and exerciſe of it) could not be Gods only end when he firſt made it, is evident from hence, that no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>quà</hi> a being, can be Gods ultimate end but his own being. All other created beings contain Gods end in their exiſtency, as they relate in that exiſtency to a dependance upon him, a ſubſerviency and ſubjection to him: Not ſimply as they are beings, ſeperately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered from the dependency and uſe of their beings. And therefore, in the denial of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63973:20"/>and Gods being any way concern'd in humane affairs, the <hi>Epicuraeans</hi> will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to confeſs God made the World without propoſing any End at all to himſelf by it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were its bare exiſtence, which ſeperate from a ſubordination to him, and a dependance upon him (all which purely relate to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence) is impoſſible to be his end in any being but his own. Secondly, all ſuch as ſay God had no end in making the World but the making of it, muſt needs upon their own ſuppoſition acknowledge, that end ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the World was once made. And then we muſt Imagine, God, by his Wiſdom and Power to frame ſuch a ſtructure as this world is, and yet deſign it to no uſe nor end at all, when it ſhould be exiſting, and that ſo great variety of ſuch excellent beings, capable of ſuch noble Ends, ſhould be made by him, with ſuch a capacity, without any farther determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or future deſign about them; and that God has continued this World, or at leaſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to continue, ever ſince it was firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting, without any regard at all to it, or any end deſigned to himſelf by it, all which is moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to conceive, that infinite Wiſdom and power ſhould ſtand by, and have no ſhare at all in ſuch an affair as the continual revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this World.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63973:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Secondly, By ſaying that God refuſeth either to govern or care for the World, that (being bleſſed and happy in himſelf) he looks no farther than the enjoyment of his own bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs within himſelf; we deny the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary effects and emanations of that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we muſt needs aſcribe to him. 'Tis a true and a general Axiome of all ſubordinate good (and much more of the higheſt good) <hi>Bonum eſt ſui Diffuſivum,</hi> that's comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its Definition. Who can believe that infinite goodneſs ſhould not delight in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating good? and ſhould deny to care for others? This principle lies ſecured in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy Breaſt here below, and ſhall we ſhut it out of Heaven? ſhall we believe God to be of a contrary Nature to what we our ſelves think beſt? that were highly to divorce our ſelves from the notion of him as our Creator; can any man reaſonably believe it conſiſting with Gods goodneſs to make a World that he knew would be ſubject to ſo much trouble and ſorrow as this is, and reſolve to be no way concern'd about it? What impotency and want does this World give us a proſpect of! or whether does it naturally tend for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but to infinite goodneſs? T'were a moſt high indignity offered to the Divine bounty to ſuppoſe God ſo to withdraw himſelf; and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63973:21"/>'tis no leſs a wrong done to mankind, to exclude them from the Rule and protection of ſuch a being as that we aſcribe to God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they muſt needs be moſt happy and beſt ſecured. 'Tis to forbid the moſt neceſſary actings of the ſupreme being, and deny to our ſelves the greateſt comfort of our own beings. VVe ſee in all things created a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural care to preſerve their off-ſpring, and a conſtant overſight of what Nature has charg'd them withall; And from whence ſhould this excellent <hi>genius,</hi> both in rational and irration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al creatures, be derived, but from the firſt framer and compoſer of all things? And can we ſuppoſe <hi>leſs</hi> in <hi>Him</hi> then he hath given to <hi>us?</hi> Can we, with any good reaſon, put that upon God which would be the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to our ſelves? VVhich is, not to take care of what belongs to us, and what we are but the Secondary Authors of? VVhen we ſee every Creature, by the Law of its being, obliged to the care of its proper and peculiar part, 'twere a moſt unworthy and unnatural conception to think the great God did not take care of the whole.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In denying Providence, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the neceſſary effects of the higheſt Juſtice: nay, of any Juſtice. Indeed, we charge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Juſtice with the greateſt Injuſtice. Were
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63973:22"/>it not ſo, if God ſhould refuſe to punniſh the vile practices of men toward himſelf and toward each other? To ſuffer them to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Him in Heaven, and to commit all outrages upon Earth, and take no notice at all of it? When, by the infinity of his knowledge, he cannot be ignorant of it, and by the infinity of his power, he cannot be unable to puniſh it? And were it not high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, ſhould we ſuppoſe no reward for the Righteous, nor regard of them? Nor any recompence for all the Virtuous Religious actions we ſee performed amongſt Mankind? Who is able ſo unworthily to conceive of God? What madneſs is it to acknowledge the perfection of all thoſe excellent Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes we can conceive off to be in God, and yet ſuppoſe an exerciſe of them beneath what we find amongſt Men! To deny that to Him which we dayly experience and applaud in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very virtuous and good Man! What good Man, in Authority, would refuſe to puniſh an offender, or reward a Worthy action? And yet, if we believe <hi>Epicurus,</hi> we muſt imagine God to ſit ſtill in Heaven, and take no notice at all either of that Good or Evil which is dayly practiced amongſt Mankind. This Doctrine of <hi>Epicurus</hi> does, in trueth, transform the notion of God into a meer Idol.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63973:22"/>'Tis in effect to ſay God has eyes, but ſees not: He has Hands, but works not: He is in Heaven, able to do what he will, but his will is to do juſt nothing. God, as he is the Supreme Maker of all, ſo he is thereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily the Supreme Lord and Ruler over all. The right of Supreme Magiſtracy is inſeper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his being, as containing the higheſt Power and Authority both Legiſlative and Executive. All Dominion, whether Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Political, is derived from him as the Head of it, and He himſelf is the Supreme Magiſtrate over the whole, and can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtand related to the World. We can no other way rightly conceive of Gods Power and Authority but as Magiſtratical, nor look upon him in any other notion then as our chief and ſupreme Ruler; and ſo are to take no meaſure of His proceedings from the actings of private perſons, but are to ſuppoſe God ſo to deal with the World as the ſupreme diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of Juſtice, and placed in the higheſt Seat of Magiſtratical Authority. And if this be true (as moſt demonſtrably 'tis ſo) how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Doctrine to a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of God! and how inconſiſtent with it! How inſeperably is providence an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to all true Conceptions of him! And what a poor account does <hi>Epicurus</hi> give us of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63973:23"/>God without it? What a Magiſtrate does he render the moſt ſupreme Magiſtrate? One that neither <hi>relieves</hi> the <hi>oppreſſed, puniſhes</hi> the <hi>guilty, rewards</hi> the <hi>well-doer,</hi> nor indeed takes any notice of what his Subjects either do or ſay. 'Tis in ſhort, impoſſible to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſupreme Magiſtracy from God; His be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſeth it; 'tis evidently proved virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and eſſentially to belong to him, from an induction of all particulars relative to it. And if ſo, 'tis extreamly unreaſonable not to ſuppoſe from his hand, the moſt compleat and perfect exerciſe of all Magiſtratical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that we are any way able to conceive of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To ſuppoſe that God declines the exerciſe of all Empire and Rule over the world, is to ſuppoſe him to decline the moſt eſſential property of his own being, and the nobleſt exerciſe of any being. Firſt, the moſt eſſential property of his own being. 'Tis as eſſential to God to Rule as to Be. Gods exiſtence, we ſay, is a neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; He cannot but be; which implies a neceſſary ſuperiority. That which cannot but, <hi>be,</hi> cannot but be above all. For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has a power ſuperior to it, has a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not to <hi>be.</hi> And that which cannot but be <hi>above</hi> all, cannot but Rule <hi>over</hi> all. Becauſe,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63973:23"/>the very <hi>being</hi> of ſuperiority lies in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>Dominion,</hi> and cannot be upheld with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. To fancy the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of infinite Power without <hi>exerciſe,</hi> is to frame an <hi>Idol</hi> in in our own imaginations, and to fancy what is in it ſelf impoſſible to be. Infinite Power to Rule, implies infinite Actual Rule. We can never ſeparate between infinite <hi>Power</hi> and infinite <hi>Dominion.</hi> The being of the one neceſſarily implies the other. Whatever is in God is actually in him. God has not only virtually an infinite power, but an infinite power in Act. Infinite power muſt needs be in continual Act, and cannot be otherwiſe, becauſe Infinite. And therefore all things muſt needs be in ſubjection to it. VVe are ſo to conceive of all Gods Attributes as things not only in <hi>Potentia,</hi> but in <hi>Facto eſſe.</hi> Gods infinite VViſdom is not onely an <hi>ability</hi> to be wiſe, but an infinite <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Exertion</hi> of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So his infinite <hi>knowledg</hi> is not only an infinite <hi>capacity</hi> of knowing, and <hi>ability</hi> to know, but an infinite actual knowledge of all things, excluding an <hi>ignorance</hi> of <hi>anything.</hi> 'Twere to annex imperfection to Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to ſay, they are not in <hi>exerciſe; Power,</hi> in its <hi>exerciſe,</hi> implies <hi>Dominion.</hi> 'Tis from <hi>defect</hi> where 'tis not ſo <hi>exerted.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from infinite <hi>Power</hi> in which there can be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63973:24"/>no <hi>defect,</hi> muſt needs ariſe infinite <hi>Dominion.</hi> 'Twas a childiſh conceit of <hi>Epicurus</hi> to think that infinite Power could be <hi>ſet by,</hi> and not be in continual <hi>operation,</hi> or that any thing could move, act, or exiſt, without a neceſſary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to infinite Power. Should the world rule it ſelf, and be under no ſubjection, Gods Power would ceaſe to be, what it can never but be, which is, infinite in its Supremacy. Should any one thing be done in the VVorld and not come under the exerciſe of Gods ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and Sovereign Rule, his Power would ceaſe to be Infinite, becauſe not <hi>actually</hi> above all: VVhich it can never be unleſs it <hi>actually Rule</hi> over all.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Were it a ſuppoſition capable of admiſſion, or ſuch a thing as could pretend to a poſſibility, that infinite power could be <hi>ſet by,</hi> and <hi>exiſt</hi> without <hi>exerciſe,</hi> who could em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſo groſs an abſurdity as to believe that God ſhould thus determine with himſelf, that the beſt <hi>uſe</hi> that could be made of infinite Power, were, to make <hi>no uſe at all</hi> of it! And ſo, having at firſt made the World by his wiſdome and Power, ſhould leave it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to its own <hi>Chanceable</hi> revolutions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther effect or communication of either.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63973:24"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſuppoſe God (in declining the Rule of the World) to decline the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt exerciſe of <hi>any</hi> being. VVe can think of nothing more excellent then <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> to imploy the largeſt mind, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the compleateſt virtues. And is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to diveſt the higheſt Power of it? To <hi>have</hi> Power, and to <hi>uſe</hi> it for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is that we moſt applaud amongſt men. Thoſe beſt faculties we have (by which we can only conceive of Gods excellent nature) their <hi>Perfection</hi> lies in <hi>Communication.</hi> He that Rules <hi>well,</hi> does the <hi>beſt</hi> thing we can frame an <hi>idaea</hi> of. And therefore the Rule of the VVorld is the moſt excellent thing we can aſcribe to God. <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his 2 Book <hi>De Nat. Deor.</hi> ſpeaks fully to this. <hi>Nihil eſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>praeclarius mundi adminiſtratione Deorum, Igitur Conſilio adminiſtratur mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus: Nihil eſt praeſtantius Deo; Ab eo igitur neceſſe eſt mundum regi.</hi> Thoſe of the beſt endowments we think the fitteſt for Empire. And the more <hi>excellent</hi> any ſoul is, the more inlarged and vigorous in <hi>action</hi> it is. And ſhall we ſuppoſe God not to Rule in Heaven? Shall we think him very vain that ſhould tell us? VVe then make the beſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane abilities, when we <hi>leaſt imploy</hi> them! Becauſe the great and natural end of all <hi>ability</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63973:25"/>for action, is action: And yet ſhall we ſuppoſe that God layes by the exerciſe of all his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite attributes, and wholly retires himſelf in Heaven? Who is able (without aſſaulting his own Reaſon) to admit ſuch conception of that excellent being we aſcribe to God, and father that upon him which would make up the Character of a very ill man.</p>
            <p>But to render the abſurdity of this Doctrine more evident to every impartial man, let me ask the <hi>Epicureans</hi> this queſtion; If God doth not rule the World, and that darling Axiome of <hi>Epicurus</hi> be true, that <hi>Quod eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num beatumque ſit nec habere ipſum negotii quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, nec exhibere alteri.</hi> How comes God to give Laws to the World? to admit the one, and ſtill to affirm the other were ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for they are inſeperable <hi>Relatives.</hi> All Laws neceſſarily relate to <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſubjection</hi> on the other hand. That God has planted a natural Law in every mans <hi>Being,</hi> relating to his own <hi>Superiority</hi> and mans <hi>Subjection,</hi> is in truth paſt all rational denial. Whence comes that inherent diſtinction of good and evil eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is born with? and which nothing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane can either alter or abrogate? but with reference to Gods authority over him? What is that we call Conſcience in every man, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63973:25"/>Gods vicegerent here below, and the Vicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general of his ſupreme Rule over the World? <hi>Epicurus</hi> perceiving that if he once admitted any ſuch thing as that we call the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or an inherent diſtinction of good and evil in Men, Providence (from thence) would neceſſarily be implied, poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it; ſaying there is no ſuch thing as the Law of Nature, nor any thing of that kind; and maintains this Hypotheſis, that there is nothing in the naked Eſſence of things that diſcriminates them; but that all difference of things comes from Cuſtom and Poſitive Law. Firſt, I muſt needs ſay that <hi>Epicurus</hi> by this Doctrine; renders himſelf unworthy of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and diſcourſe, becauſe he denies common experience, and what every man may know to be true from his own breaſt, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther information. And there needs no other demonſtration then an appeal to all impartial Reaſon in the Caſe. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayes (and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds) that no diſpute ought to be admitted againſt experience; becauſe, if I once bring that into queſtion I diſclaim all ground of certainty. And therefore amongſt all wiſe men, things of common experience are ſtill excluded and ſet aſide from all debate and diſpute. How great ſtreſs ſoever the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> lay upon this Principle (and they lay
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63973:26"/>very great upon it) both from the Reaſon of things in themſelves conſidered, and from common experience, 'tis proved to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe and pernitious. The Law of Nature I call <hi>the dictates of right Reaſon, ſhewing good or evil to be in ſome things by their agreement or diſagreement with the rational Nature, and ſo conſequently, to be commanded and forbidden by the Author of Nature, God himſelf.</hi> The truth of this definition will appear very evident; for firſt, a <hi>Natural Law</hi> muſt needs be ſeated in the <hi>Rational faculty,</hi> as being the <hi>ſuperior</hi> part of man. Nothing can truly or properly be ſaid to be a Rule or a Law to a Rational Being, ariſing from it ſelf, but the genuine dictates of Reaſon. Secondly, whatſoever my Reaſon tells me is in it ſelf good (by its agreement to that judgment my Reaſon makes of what is ſo) I muſt needs think that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nature of God, and muſt needs think my ſelf under obligation to it from God. Under obligation to it I muſt be, becauſe of mine own judgment about it; and that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt needs oblige me as a Law given to me from God; becauſe 'twas he made me with a faculty ſo judging, and is in truth himſelf the author of this Judgment by creating the faculty that neceſſarily makes it. Whatever Judgment God makes a man with, muſt needs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63973:26"/>be a Law from God given to him, and he can never depart from it without offending him that was the Author of it, and placed it within him as a Rule of his Being. Whatever judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God made me with, concerning my ſelf and all other things, is his Judgment: And what is Gods Judgment is a Law to me, and I can never <hi>oppoſe</hi> it without <hi>ſin,</hi> being in mine own exiſtence, made with a neceſſary ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto him. Now I ſay, that by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Rational faculty, and the dictates of right Reaſon, Mankind neceſſarily make ſuch a <hi>diſtinction</hi> of things; that is, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine ſome actions and ſome things to be in themſelves intrinſically good, and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſically evil, from the Nature of the things themſelves, as they ſtand related to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Judgment, abſtracted from all collateral conſiderations whatever. And there is no reaſon to be given of that, more then of the faculty of Reaſon it ſelf, that Man is created by God with a faculty ſo judging. He that denies the being of this natural Law, muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate the judgment of Reaſon, by which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man becomes a neceſſary and unrepealable Law to himſelf in his opinion of things: 'Tis effect to deny a man to be <hi>Rational,</hi> to make all things alike to him, as to the good or evil of them; becauſe the faculty we call Reaſon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63973:27"/>exiſts in every man with ſuch an innate diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. No man (uſing his Reaſon) can think falſhood and truth equally good in themſelves. Juſtice and injuſtice, Mercy and Cruelty are diſtinguiſhed by the fundamental conſtitution of our beings, and can never be equal competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to a Rational approbation. A man may well ſay, that the determinations that men make upon the plaineſt demonſtrations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon the intrinſick certainty of the Rational faculty, as to ſay, their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about good and evil do not ſo. For the one lie, every jot, as connate to the Judgment of the Rational faculty as the other. A cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt vicious man has the Judgment of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſſed Reaſon againſt him, as much as a falſe concluſion in Mathematicks: And a Virtuous man for him, as much as the moſt evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable Truth. No man (of untainted intellectuals) can equally eſteem a Religious <hi>Socrates,</hi> and a profane <hi>Caligula,</hi> and a ſenſual <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> and a virtuous <hi>Cato.</hi> Many things appear to us in themſelves intrinſically good, and ſo oblige us from the dictates of Reaſon, and thoſe primary ſtatutes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and no poſitive Law can alter or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede the Obligation. That Children ſhould obey their Parents, and not Parents the Children, has no indifferency in it; nor can
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63973:27"/>the Obligation be removed or inverted by any Cuſtom or poſitive Law, that the Deity ſhould be venerated is a Statute of Nature. <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf confeſſeth <hi>we are to venerate the Deity for its excellency.</hi> But upon what ground I would know? If upon the ground of our natural light, and an Obligation ariſing from the innate dictates of Reaſon, he muſt then admit the Laws of Nature; and, by ſo doing, 'tis certain he deſtroys his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and will be forced to acknowledge a Providence. If barely upon poſitive Law, he falls under this horrible abſurdity, to make it at the pleaſure of <hi>Men</hi> (for ſo are all things that depend meerly upon poſitive Law) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Deity ſhall be ſo venerated or no. If the being of a Deity, and the excellency of ſuch a being, be eſtabliſhed by natural light, I am ſure the <hi>Veneration</hi> of him is ſo too; and if it be not ſo eſtabliſhed, but made to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to believe whether there be ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or no, Men may then by their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure make and unmake their Gods, as they do their Pictures and Statues. When we are told we muſt venerate the Deity for its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, we are told that which is true; but as <hi>Epicurus</hi> did circumſtantiate this Doctrine, 'twas not like to produce much Religion; for, at the ſame time; he denies the being of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63973:28"/>Laws, and makes all things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, indifferent, and alſo denies all Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and any future Eſtate after this l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe, by which all rewards and puniſhments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; ſo that the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Religion is in the very foundation of it wholly Precarious, and depends upon the pleaſure of men, or elſe deſtructive to it ſelf and its own Principles. The Deity is to be venerated for its excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (ſayes the <hi>Epicureans</hi>) that is, if Men pleaſe to make Laws it ſhall be ſo; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, 'tis, in it ſelf indifferent. If they ſay, 'tis not indifferent, but that we are obliged ſo to do by a natural determination of Reaſon; that's an acknowledging of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therein an admiſſion of Providence. To ſay the Deity muſt be venerated, and at the ſame time to ſay that all actions and things are in themſelves indifferent is plainly to ſay, there are no ſtated rules for this veneration, farther than poſitive Laws make them, and that a man may practiſe any thing, the very worſt of things (ſuppoſing poſitive Laws not to forbid them) and yet be a Religious vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator of the Deity; the admiſſion of which is lothſome to all Mankind. To ſay that a Man muſt venerate the Deity, and yet to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex no reward to the doing of it, nor any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the not doing of it, here nor here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63973:28"/>is to prepare men to be Religious by telling them before hand, if they be ſo, it ſhall be no whit the better for them, and if they be not ſo, it ſhall not be one jot the worſe. This notion of <hi>Epicurus</hi> (which yet is the whole of his Divinity) ſo circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, ſeems to me ſo weak an attempt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward any thing of Religion, that I rather think of him as <hi>Cicero</hi> does, <hi>That he was a man perfectly without any Religion, and had no belief of a Deity at all.</hi> For ſo ſays he of him, in the end of his firſt Book <hi>De Nat. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. Verius eſt igitur illud nimirum quod familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris omnium noſtrum Poſidonius diſſeruit. In libro quinto De natura Deorum.

            <p>Two things (of which the whole world, in all ages, have had experience) do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover the falſhood of this poſition, that all things are in themſelves alike to mankind, till cuſtome and poſitive Law make a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Firſt, VVe find men paſſing a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon themſelves in the Cloſet of their own <hi>breaſts,</hi> accuſing and excuſing themſelves about matters no way connizable and no way determined by any poſitive Law, but meerly guided herein by the unavoidable evidence that their own Reaſon gives in concerning the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63973:29"/>good or evil of things. In all times and ages this Truth hath been eſtabliſhed. For as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> ſays truely, <hi>Time wears out errours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but confirmes all Natural truths.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans own reaſon carryes an innate condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in it to ſome things as evil, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others as good, and this no way founded in Cuſtomes or Laws of times or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in the very faculty of Reaſon it ſelf and is neither Created nor can be Abrogated by any thing humane. For, as <hi>Philo</hi> ſay well, <hi>Lex mentiri neſcia eſt recta ratio, quae Lex non ab hoc aut ab illo mortali mortalis, non in Chartis aut Columnis exanimis exanima, ſed corrumpi neſcia, quippe ab immortali natura in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculpta in immortali intellectu.</hi> If there were no Laws but poſitive, and what had their riſe among men, were men under no obligation to the natural Light of their own beings; How can we conceive rational creatures to make a Conſcience to themſelves about things no way determined by any ſuch poſitive Laws? What mens Laws reach not, no man can be reaſonably thought to be concern'd in Conſcience about, if there be no Superiour Law of God; becauſe, where there is no Law there can be no offence, and ſo no foundation of Guilt. Nor is it conceivable that cuſtome can be the foundation of ſuch <hi>Conſcience</hi> in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63973:29"/>men, and of that different <hi>Judgment</hi> they make to themſelves of things, from whence that Conſcience ariſeth; becauſe the principle upon which men go in theſe natural determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are <hi>generally</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> and agreed to by <hi>all.</hi> And 'tis highly unreaſonable to ſuppoſe the whole World ſhould every where agree in a cuſtome of judging things to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then indeed they be, and ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own breaſts to ſuch an eroneous Judgment, and that the conſtant determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the publick reaſon of the world, that ſome things are in themſelves good and others are in themſelves evil, was at firſt founded in a miſtake, and that that miſtake became cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary and univerſal. This is a thing that carries the utmoſt of improbability in it, and is in effect, to ſay <hi>mankind</hi> is not <hi>reaſonable,</hi> and to put the <hi>Fool</hi> upon the whole World. Beſides, the determinations of our Reaſon about the good or evil of things, are at the preſent juſtified to us to be pure, and abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all byas, either from cuſtome or from poſitive Laws, from the nature of the things themſelves and the moſt genuine judgment of Reaſon it ſelf in its judging of them. And he that will ſay that we are no way certain but that our beſt judgment about good and evil may be, for ought we know, grounded upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63973:30"/>cuſtome &amp; ſo miſtaken, may as well ſay that all other judgment is ſo too: And ſo in effect ſay, we are no way ſure but that all the reaſon of the world's nothing elſe but a <hi>great cuſtomary miſtake</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are natural Laws, by which things are in themſelves differenced, proved to be <hi>previous</hi> to all poſitive Laws; Becauſe all poſitive Laws appear plainly to have their riſe from thoſe primary Laws of Nature, and to ſuppoſe them. The common principles of Natures Laws have been the common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all poſitive Laws every where. How different ſoever poſitive Laws have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves in other things, yet the Grand Maxims of Nature founded upon that innate diſtinction of good and evil men are born withall have been univerſally admitted by all <hi>Legiſlators.</hi> General effects, we ſay, muſt have general cauſes. And that general conſent we find in all poſitive Laws to ſuch natural Maxims, does evidently declare ſuch Maximes to be the Univerſal ſentiments of mankind, and thoſe original Laws annexed to the beings of men in their firſt frame and conſtitution, by which things in themſelves are primarily diſcriminated antecedently to all poſitive Laws, and from whence all poſitive Laws have their ſubſequent riſe.</p>
            <p>Should this <hi>Epicurean</hi> doctrine be admitted,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63973:30"/>That all things are originally and in their own nature alike, till differenced by poſitive Law or Cuſtome, three things would evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from it; The firſt ruinous to all policy, The ſecond to all Religion, And the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to both. Firſt, No Man that thought all things originally indifferent, and the whole world and all the actions of it, as to good or evil, to be <hi>Raſa tabula,</hi> could ever be obliged farther then <hi>force</hi> or his own <hi>intereſt</hi> prevailed upon him. For if all things be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally in themſelves indifferent, and have neither good nor ill in them, 'twas then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different whether there ſhould be any <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,</hi> or any <hi>Laws made.</hi> Authority it ſelf is indifferent; and if that be it ſelf indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and have neither intrinſecal good nor evil in it, my <hi>obedience</hi> muſt needs be indifferent too. For if it be indifferent whether there ſhould be any ſuch thing as civil authority, or no, and civil Authority have no real internal good or ill annexed to it, it muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different (as to matter of inward Conſcience) whether I ſhould obey it or no. If all things be in themſelves indifferent, 'tis impoſſible for men, by poſitive Laws, to make any thing otherwiſe; becauſe the power by which thoſe poſitive Laws are made, is, in its nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different too, and has neither eſſential good
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63973:31"/>nor ill belonging to it. And if ſo, it muſt needs be indifferent to me, whether I obey it or not. For, the things they command or forbid are, in their own nature, indifferent, and the power commanding is, it ſelf, indifferent, as to its own Being, whether it ſhould ſo command or no! For although a thing in it ſelf and all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wholly indifferent ceaſeth to be ſo to me, when commanded or forbid by a poſitive Law, becauſe of the conſcience I ought to have of the authority commanding or forbidding, as having an intrinſical good in it, to which I am poſitively obliged, and as a thing in its own nature obligatory to me, yet, were that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority wholly indifferent in it ſelf, in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether it ſhould be or no, and had no eſſential good or ill in its conſtitution, it muſt needs be indifferent to me whether I ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it or not! There can never be any good or ill in obedience or diſobedience, where there is a perfect indifferency in the being of that Power that requires it. Secondly, If all things were, to mankind, in themſelves alike and indifferent, and there were no ſuch origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſtinction of good and evil make in the rational nature, 'twere impoſſible ever to frame any amiable or excellent <hi>Idaea</hi> of God. 'Twere all one whatever we thought of him; We might as well think him <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>unjuſt,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:63973:31"/>as <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>juſt.</hi> For, we have no other way to frame an <hi>Idaea</hi> of God, but from that diſtinction of good and evil we make in our own breaſts. When the <hi>Epicureans</hi> tell us <hi>We muſt venerate the Deity for its excellency,</hi> What excellency is it we can aſcribe to God? and from whence can we derive the notion of any ſuch thing? If, to our own reaſons, all things are alike, and there is no innate diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of good and evil in the rational nature, this maxime of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> does, in truth, put a total end to all well-doing, and to all well-thinking, and does utterly extinguiſh all Religion amongſt Mankind. The Nobleſt and beſt ground of all Religion is good thoughts of God, ariſing from an amiable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of him in our minds. Without this, 'tis impoſſible to be truely Religious. And this is utterly impoſſible ever to be made, (but upon groſs Deluſion and miſtake) if no one thing be, in the true judgment of men, better then another, but all things, as to their good and evil in themſelves, equal and indifferent. 'Tis that diſtinction founded in the rational nature between good and bad, and an ability ariſing from thence to frame to it ſelf an <hi>Idaea</hi> of excellency and perfection, that is the ground of all right conceptions of God. And indeed, by finding things diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63973:32"/>in our own rational nature, we come to know they are eternally diſtinguiſhed in Gods Nature: Becauſe he himſelf is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our rational nature. And 'tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to conceive he ſhould create a nature contrary to his own. And ſo we know there is not only a Reaſon in our own Breaſts why ſome things are good, and ſome things are evil, but there is an eternal Reaſon in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God why they are ſo! What I think good, I muſt neceſſarily think agreeable to God. And what I think evil, I muſt needs judge <hi>contrary</hi> to him; or elſe I do not anſwer the original notion my reaſon gives me of his being. And ſo, by the diſtinction I ſind made of things in mine own rational Nature, I come to know there is the ſame Eternal diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in Gods Nature, and ſo an unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Obligation ariſing from thence; becauſe my Reaſon tells me, Gods nature muſt be agreeable to what I think moſt excellent by the judgment of that faculty God has made me withall. And of this I am as well aſſured as I am of Gods being; for the ſame faculty that tells me God <hi>Is,</hi> tells me alſo his Nature muſt needs be agreeable to what my reaſon tells me is in it ſelf Holy and Good, and directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to whatever it tells me is in it ſelf Evil. Thirdly, were it Cuſtom and Poſitive Laws
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63973:32"/>that did only conſtitute the difference of Actions and Things, that difference muſt needs be regulated thereby. And 'twill then unavoidably follow that Cuſtom and Poſitive Laws might poſſibly invert the whole frame of things, and that univerſal opinion of Good and Evil the World is now poſſeſſed with; that is <hi>Honeſty, Truth</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> might come to be in the place of <hi>Wickedneſs, Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi> And thoſe we now think the <hi>Beſt</hi> Actions, reckoned the <hi>Worſt,</hi> and the <hi>Worſt</hi> adjudged to be the <hi>Beſt.</hi> The very mention whereof would be as <hi>Nauſeous,</hi> as the practiſe of it would prove <hi>Ruinous</hi> to humane Nature. And every man carries about him, in his own Reaſon ſuch an innate abhorrency of it as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it utterly impoſſible, upon any terms, ever to be.</p>
            <p>It would be alſo a task too hard for the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt <hi>Epicurean</hi> to give any rational account how the World (without a Divine diſpoſal, and the admiſſion of Providence) ſhould be continued in that orderly frame we ſee it! never any ſuch thing as the order of the world fell out by <hi>chance.</hi> 'Twere abſurd to ſuppoſe it, how all things (even ſome contrary to their own Nature and proper tendency) ſhould be made ſo <hi>ſubſervient</hi> as they are to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end. 'Tis not poſſible for a rational Eye
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63973:33"/>to view over the general <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the world, ariſing from the regular motion of each particular, and exclude the influence of Divine Wiſdom from it. If we look <hi>up,</hi> of how admirable conſideration is the conſtant courſe of the Heavens, and the ſuitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Heavenly Bodies to the good of things here below! though the motion by the Equator only had been more ſimple and direct, yet we ſee they have alſo an <hi>Oblique</hi> motion, whereby, with more variety, they diſpence their favours to the World. The motions of the Stars <hi>Eccentrick</hi> and <hi>Epiciclike,</hi> as the beſt obſervers of them find, not only declare the virtue of their own Materials, but plainly point to us the regulation of a ſuperior Agent, which ſeeing how far they are from the reach of all humane power, can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the Divine Being. If we look down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we find the Sea and the Waters a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Monument of Providence. The Sea kept within Bounds, and not ſuffered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, reſtrained from the natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of its own Being; which 'tis plain no humane power could effect. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Book of <hi>Wonders,</hi> owns himſelf a <hi>Convert</hi> to Providence, upon the ſingle conſideration that the Land was not drowned in the Waters, and the Earth overwhelmed with the Sea,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63973:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>which without a Divine Power muſt needs be. <hi>Strabo</hi> obſerves the ſame neceſſity of Providence from the poſition of the Waters, which (ſayes he) if you reſpect only their Quality, and ſuppoſe them left to themſelves, muſt needs take place between the Earth and the Air, when as now we behold them confined to one proper Chanel, and interfuſed in the Earth, ſo far as to make it more fruitful and uſeful, nay, we find the Water as <hi>Grotius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in ſubſerviency to the good of the whole againſt its own Nature, ſometimes moving upwards, being ſo compoſed as to ſuſtain it ſelf in ſuch motion, by a continued <hi>Cohaeſion</hi> of parts. Whereſoever we caſt our Eyes, the whole of the World, in all the parts of it, does evidently own it ſelf to the manage and product of a wiſe and excellent Providence, all things moving towards parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Ends, and all thoſe particular Ends iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into one Common End. To move to an End is the plain effect of an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Being; And therefore, when we ſee Creatures without intelligence ſtill moving both to particular and general Ends, 'tis plain they are directed by ſome intelligence. And we ſee Creatures Rational, and that have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence moving and acting to Ends ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to their own intelligence, and which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63973:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>themſelves knew not of nor intended, and yet their actings and motions towards them regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; 'tis plain they are conducted by a higher Intelligence. And this in both caſes, can be no other but the <hi>higheſt Intelligence,</hi> who at once comprehends <hi>all Ends</hi> and <hi>all Means</hi> tending to thoſe Ends; which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>'Tis likewiſe an irrefragable proof of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that many things have come to paſs in this World that have been evidently <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,</hi> and beyond all humane ability to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; which could never have been, if God be ſo withdrawn from the World as to be no way an actor in it. What will the <hi>Epicureans</hi> ſay to all the <hi>Miracles</hi> that have at any time been wrought? and to ſuch things as have come to paſs beyond all product of Nature? to deny the fact of ſuch things, and to ſay they have not been, is at once to impeach all humane Teſtimony, and to diſcard the credit of all Hiſtory. If we admit them, we muſt needs confeſs they are the effect of Gods ſupreme power, and the evident Works of his hands in a providential way; and if ſo, we ſhall ſoon diſpatch with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and ſpoil his fictitious retirement of God in the Heavens, and bring down the Divine Majeſty to an open converſe with Mankind, and indeed undeniably eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63973:34"/>both his care of, and his ſupreme Rule over this whole World.</p>
            <p>Two things there are upon which <hi>Epicurus</hi> at firſt, <hi>Lucretius, Pliny,</hi> and all the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans</hi> ſince, have chiefly juſtified their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of Providence, and Gods ſupreme Rule over the World. <hi>Firſt,</hi> (ſay they) 'tis a thing beneath the excellent Being of God, for him to concern himſelf with the affairs of this inſeriour world, and to take notice of every little paſſage here below; nor can he (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſayes) be ſuppoſed (without great diſorder to himſelf, and being withdrawn from his own delight and content) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the charge <hi>tam multiplicis &amp; triſtis Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterij: Of ſo multiplicious and ungrateful a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Secondly,</hi> (ſay they) the poſture of things in this World is ſuch, good men often ſuffering, and bad men proſpering: wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſucceeding, and Virtue miſcarrying; 'tis ſo often <hi>bene malis &amp; male bonis,</hi> that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe this World to be governed from above, and that all the affairs of it ſhould be under the conduct of ſuch perfect and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent attributes as thoſe we aſcribe to God.</p>
            <p>The firſt is ſoon anſwered, 'Tis an abſurd diminution of infiniteneſs, and inconſiſtent with it, to limit or diſtinguiſh its comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, God hath an infinite Comprehenſion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63973:35"/>and cannot but know all things together, or elſe his Knowledge were not infinite. Nor can there be any diſtinction made in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his comprehenſion; great things and ſmall things are all alike, and upon even terms, as to his comprehenſion and Knowledge of them. Nothing can be above him or below him in any ſuch reſpect: 'Tis fooliſh to ſay any thing is too mean for God to take Cognizance of; becauſe an univerſal Cognizance of all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, is included and neceſſarily implied in the infinity of his Knowledge, So far the miſtake is plain and viſible; nothing can poſſibly happen, of which we can ſay God takes no notice: But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all things that come to paſs are known to him, yet (ſay the <hi>Epicureans</hi>) 'tis not fit to conceive, he any way concerns himſelf about them, or that he will ſo far trouble or diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf, as to undertake the Rule and Regulation of them; which lazy, ſlothful dream of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> above all his other Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes, has expoſed him to the juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all ſober and intelligent men; 'tis ſo groſs and unworthy a conception of the ſupreme Being, and ſo great an indignity offered unto him, and moſt evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all thoſe notious that reſult from the true exerciſe of our Reaſons about
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63973:35"/>him, and that will eaſily appear ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I acknowledge there are ſome things God cannot do, God cannot deny himſelf, nor do any thing againſt the Nature of his own Being, That reſults from the perfection of his Being, and is included in the neceſſity of it: But to ſay that whatſoever God can do; that is, can do, as being no way contrary to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do, and ſo has a poſſibility, he may do (I ſpeak not of the bare Imaginary ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what God can do in reſpect of his unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited power; for ſo we may conceive he may deſtroy the World in a Moment; but his power cannot be actually ſo exerted; that's but a vain ſantaſm, unleſs it be correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his Juſtice, his Mercy, and his other excellent attributes) but to ſay, whatever God can do in ſuch a ſenſe; that is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not inconſiſtent with his Being to do, and ſo may be done by him, he cannot do without trouble to himſelf, and diſorder to his own excellent Nature, is to deny the eſſentiality of his Being: The inſeperable and eſſential property of Gods Being is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Now if he cannot perfectly act what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he can act, he is not eſſentially perfect, but has a poſſibility of imperfection annexed to his Being. To ſay God could govern this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63973:36"/>World if he pleaſed, 'twere no way contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to his Being to do it; but yet if he ſhould do it, it would trouble and diſcompoſe him, is to deny his perfection, and plainly admit him capable of imperfection, which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to all true notions of his Being; 'tis to ſuppoſe, God cannot perfectly do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be done by him, and to ſuppoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection not to accompany the utmoſt poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his acting, which is to deny his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and conſequently the moſt inſeperable property of his Being. Nor can any man ſay, the Government of this World, in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, can have any contrariety in it to Gods Being; becauſe Goverment in its Own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt needs be moſt ſuitable to his Being, and 'tis the certain way to bring the whole World into perfect conformity to him. And to ſay, 'tis contrary to his Being; becauſe it would be a trouble to him, is plainly to ſay, 'tis contrary to his Being; becauſe his Being is <hi>imperfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is to meaſure out <hi>Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (which can have no meaſure) by <hi>Finite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 'Tis in ſhort, to meaſure out God to our ſelves by our <hi>own Line;</hi> and when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Being to be compleat in all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfections, to meaſure out the actings of thoſe perfections by our own greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63973:36"/>and what can be more vain and leſs reaſonable, then to carry up thoſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we make in our own Actings, to the Actings of God, whom we acknowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and perfect, when thoſe diſtinctions ariſe, viſibly from our own imperfection in Acting. 'Tis the limited extent of our own Beings that makes us reckon things <hi>above</hi> us, and <hi>below</hi> us; no ſuch diſtinction can be made where there is infiniteneſs of Knowledge, and infiniteneſs of power. All things are under an even conſideration to ſuch infinite Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; and 'tis becauſe of our own great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that labour and trouble attends us in what we do: and ſhall we ſuppoſe God capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that, in the exerting of his infinite and perfect Attributes? 'Twas moſt unlike a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher to ſay, God would not govern the World, nor take any care of it; becauſe it would trouble him ſo to do. 'Twas plainly in other terms, to utter this contradiction, God, who is infinitely perfect, would not govern the World, becauſe he is imperfect. <hi>Epicurus,</hi> by this Divinity of his, deſerves to be reckoned with ſuch of the prolane and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Poets, who uſually aſcribed the <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> (nay, the <hi>debaucheries</hi>) of the Worſt Men to the Beſt of their Gods, and transferred the higheſt notions they had of their Gods to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63973:37"/>very ill men; and amongſt ſuch <hi>Cicero</hi> ranks him, and concludes againſt his Divinity with this very good poſition. <hi>Nihil eſt quod Deus efficere non poteſt, &amp; ullo ſine labore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the happineſs of the Deity lies in a total retreat to his own perfections, and the concerns of the world would be a trouble to him. If that be a ſufficient Reaſon againſt all Providence, 'tis much more ſo againſt all Creation, and whoever upon that account does with <hi>Epicurus</hi> deny Gods providential Rule and Dominion, is engaged to embrace the whole of his other Doctrines againſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: for would it trouble and diſcompoſe the Deity to Rule the World now, it muſt needs do ſo to make it before. It that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be good againſt <hi>Providence</hi> now, 'twas good againſt <hi>Creation</hi> at firſt; either God act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the grand Principle of his own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city then, or elſe 'tis conſiſtent with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence now. Beſides that, tis Childiſh to think God would make any thing too <hi>high</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> too <hi>low</hi> for his own <hi>Dominion;</hi> or that he ſhould <hi>Create</hi> a World that would be a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to himſelf to <hi>Govern:</hi> Nor can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that any thing God thought fit at firſt to make, and be himſelf the Author of, ſhould ever be unworthy of his <hi>care,</hi> or beneath his <hi>Regulation.</hi> 'Twere to impeach his <hi>wiſdom</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:63973:37"/>in <hi>making,</hi> or his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in <hi>not regarding</hi> what himſelf at firſt <hi>produced.</hi> God muſt needs know alſo from everlaſting all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Conſequences of what he at the firſt made. He ſaw, <hi>uno intui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u,</hi> whatever would happen and come to paſs. And 'tis no way ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſable that God (with ſuch afore-ſight and infinite Comprehenſion of all things) ſhould <hi>make</hi> ſuch a World, the future Effects and Conſequences whereof ſhould be unworthy his <hi>notice,</hi> or unfit for him to <hi>diſpoſe,</hi> or a trouble to him to <hi>regard.</hi> Or indeed, that any thing ſhould ever come to paſs, from what God firſt gave an Exiſtence to, that ſhould not naturally and neceſſarily fall under his <hi>Regulation,</hi> and be moſt ſuitable to his <hi>Dominion,</hi> and the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tion of his own excellent Attributes, and be, at laſt, over-ruled by him to ſome wiſe and excellent End.</p>
            <p>The other Objection made againſt Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, from the <hi>various ſucceſſes</hi> all humane Actions are accompanied with; ſometimes the worſt Actions, and the worſt Men proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, and the beſt miſcarrying, is that which the greateſt oppoſers of Providence have ſtill moſt applauded themſelves in. And ſo far it prevailed with ſome <hi>Philoſophers</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that although they admitted of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63973:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>in all <hi>natural</hi> things, ſuppoſing they could not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> without it, yet they much doubted, if not wholly denyed it, in all things <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Political.</hi> 'Tis from hence, no doubt, that the greateſt <hi>Atheiſm</hi> in the world hath ariſen. Men have taken occaſion from hence not only to diſpute the notion of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but to queſtion the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> thinking them (as indeed they are) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable Relatives; and not only upon a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſideration of the various and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſpoſal of things; but Men have alſo taken up Pikes againſt Providence and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon <hi>particular</hi> occaſions; becauſe their own Intereſts were not gratified thereby. Hence it was that <hi>Diagoras</hi> firſt ſet up for an <hi>Atheiſt;</hi> becauſe the Gods did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtrike a perjured Perſon dead in the place, as he deſired. Hence it was that <hi>Cato</hi> (though a Stoical aſſerter of Providence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) when he ſaw the Affairs of the <hi>Roman</hi> State decay under the conduct of <hi>Pompey,</hi> whom he eſteemed a Patriot of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and wiſhed well to, and beheld <hi>Caeſar</hi> proſpering in his attempts to what he thought a tyranny, he falls ſoul upon Providence, and profeſſed, that he ſaw a fallacious inſtability in the Government of the Gods: That <hi>Pompey</hi> was ever ſuccesful when he did
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63973:38"/>no good with his victories, but never proſpered when he implied his Armies for the freedom of his Countrey. Hence it was that <hi>Cotta</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi> makes ſo great an Harangue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Providence. That the two <hi>Scipio's</hi> and ſo many good Patriots had <hi>miſcarried,</hi> and in particular, that his Uncle <hi>Rutilius</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and his friend <hi>Druſus</hi> ſlain. But ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all thoſe particular occaſions, and private Intereſts, upon which men have been driven to a diſguſt of the notion of Providence, (which yet have been, and ſtill are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and frequent) The <hi>general</hi> courſe of the World is viſibly ſuch as gives a real Ground to this Objection: And therefore a diſtinct and particular Anſwer ought to be given to it.</p>
            <p>As God, in making the World has left us undeniable Evidence, that he himſelf is the Author of it, but yet has left us without an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to many queſtions men may ask about it, and made it very ſuitable to our reaſon to think we ſhould be ſo left, and to ſuppoſe a ſinite capacity not fully able to comprehend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Infinite Wiſdom and Power, ſo in his <hi>Rule</hi> over the World we have undeniably Evidence that he does <hi>Rule;</hi> but in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of his doing it we ſee many paſſages that far out-go our comprehenſion, If any man
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63973:39"/>ſay, that in Gods firſt <hi>make</hi> of the World we acquieſce ſingly in his <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> nor need we go farther therein then the bare act of his Will; but in his <hi>Rule</hi> of the World 'tis not ſo; there we expect the viſible effects of his Juſtice, ſuitable to thoſe natural Laws he has given to us, and that capacity of judging between juſt and unjuſt, by which we aſcend upward, and come to be aſcertained, that there is a ſupreme and perfect Juſtice in God. I anſwer, 'tis true that Gods Will was the great Reaſon, at firſt, of the <hi>make</hi> of the world; but yet we muſt look upon his <hi>Will</hi> as the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; God could not <hi>will</hi> to make any thing that would not be <hi>Wiſely</hi> made, when it was made, nor can we ſuppoſe he ſhould. And yet 'twere as reaſonable to deny Gods <hi>make</hi> of the World; becauſe I cannot ſee the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Effects of his Wiſdom in every part of it, as to deny his <hi>Rule</hi> of the World; becauſe in every paſſage of it his Juſtice is not viſible to me. All the Philoſophers heretofore agreed to this, as a general Truth, that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> produced nothing in vain: And yet never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nor all of them could give a diſtinct account of the Reaſon and Uſe of every particular. If there be ſufficient ground to aſſure me, that God made the World in the <hi>general,</hi> 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63973:39"/>to queſtion the Wiſdom or the Reaſon of any Particular. So if there be Evidence ſufficient to eſtabliſh Gods general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence over the whole, his Juſtice in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars is thereby neceſſarily implied. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Providence in general is not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon ſuch rational grounds as every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced man muſt needs acquieſce in, but in many things we are experimentally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Being of it, from the Effects of it. He that denies the exiſtence of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, can admit but of two ways, by which any thing can be ſuppoſed to come to paſs; either from the Moral determinations of Men and their Actings thereupon, or elſe from ſome purely <hi>Natural</hi> Cauſe. Now 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that many things have and do come to paſs in a viſible judicial way, which have not their riſe from any humane Judgment, nor can, with any good Reaſon, be derived from any natural operation, and can be aſcribed to nothing elſe but Gods ſupreme Judgment. Virtue and Religion have been often reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wickedneſs brought to a due puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before Mens Eyes in this World, by ways unthought of and undeſigned by any, and out of the reach of all humane Authority, and in ſuch a manner as no man, impartially judging, can poſſibly imagine to come to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63973:40"/>paſs by a meerly caſual conjunction of natural Cauſes, but muſt needs acknowledge an effect of Divine Juſtice therein. And of this we are informed by the Records of all Ages; and no one Age paſſeth without ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it.</p>
            <p>This objection (how great ſoever it may ſeem to be) will be ſufficiently removed in every candid opinion, if two things be made appear. Firſt, That there is good ground upon which to eſtabliſh the belief of a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in <hi>general,</hi> which hath been proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And Secondly, that a ſatisfactory account may be given how the preſent courſe of the world and this providence may very well conſiſt together. And this latter may be done by the conſideration of two things; Firſt, our own great Incapacity to judge of the whole of providence, or of very many parts of it. And ſecondly, the rational ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Future State.</hi> The firſt ought to make us cautious not to impeach providence haſtily, nor to deny it when we cannot fully comprehend it. The ſecond ought fully and finally to ſatisfy us in all ſuch caſes where we ſee Gods providence and his juſtice are not in this world reconcileable. For the firſt, How reaſonable is it to conceive that the ways and methods of God in his providence ſhould not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63973:40"/>be fully graſped by our comprehenſion, when he is ſo much above us in thoſe excellent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes by which they are contrived and brought about. The Rule of the world and the harmony of providence in conducting all things to a <hi>common end,</hi> is an effect of the ſame infinity by which the world was at firſt produced. 'Tis unreaſonable for us, when God Rules, to expect an exact and perfect Knowledg of all his proceedings. No hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane abilities can create a competent Judg of the whole, or of very many particular parts of Gods providential Rule over the World, and that for theſe three Reaſons. Firſt, God knows the <hi>Aims, Ends</hi> and <hi>Intentions</hi> of all Men in what they do; he ſees the <hi>inſide</hi> as well as the <hi>outſide</hi> of the whole World, and proceeds according to the compleatneſs and intire Circumſtances of every Action. This we are no way capable of, and ſo, in many paſſages of his Providence, no fit Judges of his proceedings. 'Tis a great piece of folly to judg of Concluſions, when we are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Premiſes; and to call in queſtion Gods determinations, when we know not the grounds of them. Secondly, God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to accompliſh and bring about in this World, of which we are totally ignorant, and 'tis very unwiſe to find fault with what
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63973:41"/>God does, and be angry that we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it when we know nothing of thoſe Ends 'tis deſigned to. 'Twas weakly done of <hi>Cato,</hi> and a great defection from his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> to fall foul upon Providence; becauſe he could not find out a Reaſon why <hi>Caeſar</hi> had the conqueſt of <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he muſt needs be ignorant of that future <hi>Monarchy</hi> (and all the Conſequences of it) God deſigned to ſet up in <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the foundation of his <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</hi> We ſee often, by a ſubſequent courſe of Providence, great Reaſon for that of which we could give no account at firſt. The future Events of good Mens <hi>ſufferings</hi> often reveal to us a ſufficient Reaſon for it, and reconcile mens opinions to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of Providence. The impunity of ill Men in the worſt Actions becomes ſometimes very intelligible to us even in this World, by the after diſpoſal of things. This we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently diſcourſed of in <hi>Plutarchs</hi> incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Treatiſe <hi>De ſera Numinis vindicta.</hi> Had the famous <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſuffered what was due to the eminent ſins of his Youth, what a loſs had the World had of the Virtues of his riper years? and as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells the <hi>Athenians,</hi> if <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> had been puniſhed as the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his Youth deſerved, and <hi>Miltiades</hi> for his rebellion in <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> where had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63973:41"/>been (ſayes he) thoſe great Victories, thoſe two afterwards obtained in the Plains of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rathon</hi> on the Coaſts of <hi>Arleſia?</hi> and at the River <hi>Eurimedon?</hi> The truth is, in all humane Judgment we are bounded by particulars. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual actions are the Grounds upon which Men proceed. Nor can they look forward to know what any will be hereafter. But God has the <hi>whole</hi> of every Man before him, and has not only reſpect to the All of every Action, but to the <hi>All</hi> of every <hi>Man,</hi> in the <hi>whole</hi> of of his Actings from the <hi>Firſt</hi> to the <hi>Laſt.</hi> Thirdly. There is a <hi>Harmony</hi> in Providence, which (unleſs we knew All, from its <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to its <hi>Ending</hi>) we can never fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. 'Tis one intire <hi>Syſtem,</hi> a compleat <hi>Bottom</hi> wherein all <hi>Ends</hi> are exactly wound up: A rare contrivance of <hi>Divine Wiſdom:</hi> A cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious piece of Divine Workmanſhip, wherein all particulars are ſo Interwoven as to make up the beauty of the whole. All the paſſages of the world, from firſt to laſt, have, in the providential Dominion of God over them, ſome dependency each upon other, and are not to be fully judged off ſingly, and a part. No One Action but relates to Millions of others; nay, has ſome reference to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the firſt to the laſt of the world. Each particular hath ſome reference to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63973:42"/>
               <hi>whole,</hi> like the Parts of a Natural Body, where every Part refers to the Whole: And is not, in its uſe, to be fully comprehended without an exact knowledge of the Whole. Every part of Providence hath ſomewhat in it Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to all the reſt. Though God be Juſt in each particular, yet he ſtill executes his Juſtice to every part with reference to the Whole; And ſo, Times and Orders all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that the <hi>beautiful</hi> ſeaſon of every part is, when it bears its exact proportion to the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the Whole. Nor can we ſuppoſe this to be otherwiſe, but that God, who by an Infinite comprehenſion had all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and before him, ſhould ſo rank and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, that at laſt the whole buſineſs of the World, ſhould appear but One compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and orderly united <hi>Means</hi> to bring about the firſt deſigned <hi>Ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conſideration of our own incapacity to make a full and compleat Judgment of the whole, or of many parts of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ought to prevent ſuch raſh Cenſures as Men are too apt to make upon it: And to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them not to <hi>deny</hi> it, where they cannot fully <hi>comprehend</hi> it: And to anſwer, in many caſes, the doubts men may propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about this matter; but does not anſwer this Objection fully. Becauſe 'tis not to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63973:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>denied, but that there are very many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes wherein Gods Juſtice and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are viſibly not to be reconciled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this World. And upon that conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I ſay 'tis much more reconcileable and natural to ſuppoſe the Being of a future <hi>ſtate</hi> after this life (by which all Objections againſt Providence are fully anſwered) then to make that an Objection againſt Providence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Being of it thereupon, and that upon theſe two grounds. Firſt, the exiſtence of a <hi>general</hi> Providence is, upon convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence proved to us. We have as good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe God <hi>Rules</hi> the World; as we have to believe that he is <hi>Juſt.</hi> And in that caſe, when we find we cannot, here in this World, accommodate his <hi>Rule</hi> and his <hi>Juſtice</hi> together, 'tis not reaſonable to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the one by the other (when neither can be rationally denied) but to admit a <hi>ſtate</hi> beyond this World, by which they are both ſafely reconciled. Secondly, there is nothing in the admiſſion of a future ſtate, in it ſelf any way unreaſonable: Nay, the exiſtence of ſuch a future ſtate after this life, beſides the evidence it has from the notion of Providence, has alſo many other rational proofs peculiarly appurtenant to it, and is a thing in it ſelf, upon other grounds, highly probable. He
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63973:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>that will bottom a denial of Providence ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this Objection, muſt prove that there is no ſtate of things after this life, or at leaſt, have it granted to him. The proof of it is impoſſible, and the grant of it were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, when 'tis a natural and neceſſary conſequent to all that rational proof that is made of a Providence in general, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny the one without rejecting the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the thing in its own Nature, is greatly credible, and has been believed in all Ages, not only by the greateſt part of the wiſeſt and beſt, but even of the rudeſt and moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſtrongly tend to perſwade us the belief of it is founded in the dictates of right Reaſon, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sentiments of Nature.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be taken as an undeniable Truth, that the exiſtence of Providence, and the Being of a future ſtate have a neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency each upon other, and are no way ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. If there be a Providence, there muſt be a future ſtate after this life. And if there be a ſtate hereafter, it muſt relate to a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence here: The <hi>Epicureans</hi> therefore deny both. <hi>Epicurus</hi> under all his preſſures made his retreat to this Maxime, <hi>That there had been</hi> a time when we were <hi>not in Being,</hi> and there would be a time when we ſhould
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63973:43"/>exiſt no more. Of how little a ſignification to the World the bare notion of a Deity would prove, abſtracted from the belief of a Providence here, or any ſtate hereafter, is eaſie to diſcern. The Truth is, whoever admits the exiſtence of a <hi>Supreme</hi> and firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will be rationally forced to acknowledge the other two. If there be a God, he muſt Rule: Infinite power cannot be ſet by; and if he do Rule, there muſt be a reverſion of rewards and puniſhments after this life, ſo <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves. The ſame Reaſon which confirms Providence, doth likewiſe confirm the immortality of the Soul: And if the one be taken away, the other follows; ſo that the great fundamentals of all Virtue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will appear ſufficiently juſtified to us from the regular determinations of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe and many other invincible proofs is Gods providential Rule over the World eſtabliſhed. The true notion of which frees us from the manifold abſurdities of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> his <hi>chance,</hi> and <hi>Chryſippus</hi> his <hi>deſtiny,</hi> the two wide extreams on either hand. The firſt is the pooreſt account that ever was given of ſuch Oeconomy as we ſee in this World, and a monſtrous piece of folly, to think <hi>Chance</hi> ſhould be <hi>Predominant</hi> whilſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63973:44"/>infinite <hi>wiſdome</hi> is exiſting. The other ſuch an unreaſonable and abuſive fiction of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (if related to God) as renders it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the freedom of a Rational A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. The one denies all providence and makes God to do nothing: The other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys mans freedome, and makes God to do every thing. Both equally falſe. 'Tis true, that God Rules over the <hi>Whole;</hi> And 'tis as true that his <hi>Rule</hi> no way deſtroys the freedom of mans <hi>will.</hi> Nor is the world ſubjected to any ſuch thing as a <hi>Stoical Fate,</hi> from any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary connection of cauſes, but all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men proceed from the free choice and determinations of their own breaſts. Every mans own <hi>Will</hi> being the true cauſe of his own <hi>doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much may ſerve to ſilence and ſhame all the ignorant doubts and profane denials of providence, to aſſure men there is a God that Rule's in the earth, and to juſtifie the exerciſe of a ſupreme <hi>'Dominion</hi> over the world. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the truth of which the validity of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws muſt neceſſarily depend. Such who (in the third place) admit the being of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> but reject the <hi>Chriſtian-religion</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Bible,</hi> as not true, and cloſe with ſome other in oppoſition to it, againſt thoſe the whole of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63973:44"/>this diſcourſe will chiefly tend. If the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> be ſufficiently made good, and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> proved in trueth to be what themſelves tell us they are, <hi>Laws ſent us from God, by which he will Rule and judge the world,</hi> two things will reſult from it, firſt, All <hi>other Religions</hi> but the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appear to be <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>fictitious.</hi> Secondly, Such who have embraced the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> will be abundantly confirmed in the <hi>verity</hi> thereof, freed from all ſuch doubts as may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe about it, and be aſcertained of the truth of thoſe <hi>grounds</hi> upon which it is eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this matter, when we deal with <hi>Antiſcriptural men,</hi> ſuch as pay no homage at all to the <hi>Bible,</hi> nor yield any obedience to its Authority, two things are to be avoided, and ought not to be inſiſted on, in order to their confutation. Firſt, 'Tis not a reaſonable ſtep towards it, to ſay the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> are the <hi>Principle</hi> upon which our <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>built,</hi> and therefore ought to be <hi>granted</hi> to us: Becauſe, in every particular Science, ſome <hi>Principles</hi> muſt be <hi>granted</hi> as the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum;</hi> without which it cannot be upheld, and by a <hi>denial</hi> of which the <hi>being</hi> of it is <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi> This unwary demand is the ready way to ſix <hi>every</hi> man in his <hi>own profeſsion</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, and to prevent the moſt important
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63973:45"/>
               <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> amongſt <hi>all</hi> ſuch who have already embraced <hi>any</hi> Religion; for there is <hi>no</hi> Religion without ſome <hi>prime Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> upon which 'tis erected, and by the <hi>grant</hi> of which it will be eſtabliſhed. And as we are ſure 'twill be equally expected, ſo there is no better ground upon which it can be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Nor no leſs reaſon why <hi>we</hi> ſhould admit the principles of <hi>other mens</hi> Religion, then <hi>they</hi> grant <hi>ours.</hi> And if ſo, we ſhall ſoon come to a full point in all our <hi>debates</hi> about <hi>different Religions.</hi> To ſuch who have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cloſed with the <hi>Chriſtian-profeſsion,</hi> this holds good. And he that admits not the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as the firſt <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of all diſcourſe upon any internal point of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Religion,</hi> is not to be diſputed with. Becauſe, in diſowning that principle, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the <hi>being</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> he is contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, and ſubverts the <hi>whole</hi> by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his diſputing about a <hi>part.</hi> But when we deal with men <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to it, and the doubt is about the <hi>Scripture it ſelf,</hi> we cannot otherwiſe defend it then by admitting it a matter <hi>Debateable,</hi> and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring its juſtification upon principles <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to us <hi>both,</hi> and ſuch <hi>rational grounds</hi> as carry in them the greateſt <hi>aptneſs</hi> to <hi>convince</hi> ſuch <hi>opponents.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:63973:45"/>
            <p>'Tis not to be denied but that in all Ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enquiries after truth and all <hi>humane</hi>-debates, there muſt be ſome <hi>common maxims</hi> and <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> acknowledged on <hi>all ſides,</hi> without which there can be no due meaſures of any diſcourſe, nor any Standard by which a man can proceed either to ſatisfy himſelf or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince another, and 'twill be utterly impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ever to come to a rational end of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate whatever. For, If <hi>one</hi> thing be to be proved (as it muſt be where things are in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy) by <hi>another,</hi> and every thing may be ſtill denied, we muſt prove <hi>in infinitum.</hi> He that oppoſeth needs nothing to help him but a bare <hi>Negative,</hi> and he that is to prove will be loſt in an endleſs circle. Some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples therefore there are which govern all mens thoughts and diſcourſes as things <hi>granted</hi> by them, and are of abſolute neceſſity to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conduct of the World. And they are of two ſorts; Firſt, Such as are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo obviouſly true to our <hi>Senſes</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> that they gain an <hi>Univerſal Aſſent,</hi> and are approved by the common <hi>Vote</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi> Theſe are ſuch things as no man can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to deny if he would, no more then he can deny himſelf to be <hi>Reaſonable;</hi> and do diſcover to us the truth of the rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by the natural Emanation of which we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63973:46"/>fix upon many poſitions as undoubtedly true and beyond all queſtion or diſpute, and from thence meaſure out the truth of all other things. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, <hi>that in all acquiſition of knowledg there is a proceeding from premiſſes known and agreed, to concluſions that before were not known nor agreed.</hi> Theſe firſt principles are ſecured by the innate rectitude of the rational faculty. Theſe prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their conſonancy to the rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cannot be otherwiſe proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the ground and foundation of all other proof. And of theſe 'tis true what the Schools ſay, <hi>A poſteriori poſſunt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtari, non per aliquid prius probari.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever knowledge we find attained to amongſt Mankind, 'tis deduced from theſe firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and is a Science ſubalternated to them. 'Tis from hence that all thoughts and debates are ſteered to ſome end, and guided to ſome concluſion. Theſe principles are not to be confined to any enumeration, being of equal extent with the rational capacity it ſelf, and are occaſionally produced by our reaſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various objects 'tis converſant about. Nor can any other Character be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of them but that they are <hi>ſuch genuine Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of Reaſon, as become ſelf-evident Maximes to the univerſal Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:63973:46"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There are <hi>acquired</hi> principles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mankind, which are taken as granted truths, and proceeded upon as ſuch, that are not of this firſt nature: Theſe ſecondary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples lye more remote from the firſt view of our reaſon, and are diſcovered by a chain of <hi>Inductions;</hi> and our aſſent to them proceeds from an <hi>Induſtrious exerciſe of reaſon,</hi> by which we come at length to acknowledg their verity, as agreeing to that <hi>idaa</hi> of truth we find ſeated in the rational Nature, and correſponding to thoſe primary dictates of Reaſon, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true with them. Theſe things men acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally make principles to themſelves; and, laying them aſide from debate, as things granted and agreed to, proceed to ſuperſtruct other notions and principles upon them; ſuch principles as theſe (in the purſuit whereof mankind doth greatly differ, and often mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake) are the reaſonable bounds of all ſuch future debates as are bottom'd upon them, but ought not to be impoſed when the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples themſelves are in queſtion, nor upon ſuch who make it their buſineſs to oppoſe them as erroneous and miſtaken. When two <hi>Mabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi> are in diſpute, the authority of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran is,</hi> to them, a proper <hi>Umpirage,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a principle granted by both. But when a <hi>Mahumetan</hi> diſputes with a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63973:47"/>proof of the Alchoran it ſelf muſt precede any proof he can make of Religion from thence; becauſe whatever is it ſelf under queſtion and doubt, can never be a Rule to determine other controverſies by.</p>
            <p>Nor ought this (the fact whereof is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified to us) to ſeem ſtrange, that men ſhould often miſtake and generally differ and divide upon all ſuch acquired principles, as they do, that 'tis hard, if not impoſſible, to find an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance wherein the whole World have been able univerſally to take one ſtep together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe firſt and irriſiſtible inſtitutes of Knowledge, and thoſe primary Elements of a rational Being. 'Tis no way ſtrange to ſee what is laid as a foundation by one, ſhould ſeem an abſolute nullity in the mind of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What one man reſigns up himſelf to, as his guide, another ſhould reject with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. If we conſider, firſt the difficulty wherewith all acquired knowledg is attained, and the various paths men tread towards it: How hard it is to reduce things to a Harmony with the rational Nature! With what labour and ſweat of the mind we come to meaſure out things by the line of our Reaſon, and to find out thoſe proper Mediums of demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that lie in a direct line to the truth of any propoſition! And how natural is it to doubt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63973:47"/>and object to the utmoſt in all rational pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion! Secondly, with what various abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the World is capacitated for all intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual attainments! and how differently men do improve their knowing faculty! Firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ariſe from the Truth of our Reaſon in its naked exiſtence; but all ſecond Principles from the exerciſe and improvement of it. How few be there that travel ſo far as their own Reaſon would guide them! or ſuffer that noble faculty to do what it would do! What unequal concerns have Mankind about Truth! 'Tis the Jewel and delight of ſome, 'Tis an abſolute Drug to others. Some men make the Talent of their Reaſon ten Talents; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others fold up their knowing faculty in the ſlumber of a drowzie ſenſuality. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the World ſit down ſatisfied with what they do know, not what they might know: And chooſe a lazy enjoyment of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and errour, rather then an inquiſitive poſſeſſion of Truth. Men are not only born of ſeveral Statures in the knowing part; but they continually render themſelves ſo, by the various and different improvement of thoſe abilities they poſſeſs. Thirdly, the faculty of our Reaſon it ſelf renders all things capable of diſpute and debate that are not bounded with viſible contradiction to its own Being,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63973:48"/>and are beyond the limits of thoſe primary Laws it neceſſarily gives to it ſelf, and makes various determinations about all ſuch diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters, and very often where we may well ſuppoſe an equal ability on both ſides, men differ about the ſame thing. The cauſe whereof muſt not be imputed to any innate defect in the rational Nature, as if God had made us with a lame faculty (for whoever denies the truth of that, muſt needs retort the lie to himſelf; becauſe he has no other faculty to judge by) but the true Reaſon of it lies collaterally, either firſt, From the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty relative to our Reaſon, in the Objects 'tis converſant about, from whence may well be ſuppoſed to ariſe various and different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents: for all things are not in their own Nature capable of poſitive determinations; we meet with few things without ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, but with very many things that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſe us: with ſome things ſo much out of our reach that they exceed all bounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, are beyond the Verge of <hi>Problems,</hi> and ſerve only to ſhew us the limits of a finite underſtanding. Or Secondly, from the want of ſuch perfect information, as is requiſite to ground a compleat and perfect Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There being not a little ſhare of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gueſs and conjecture mingled with moſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63973:48"/>of our Knowledge of things, which nothing but experience can deliver us from. Or Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (which is moſt general, and an undeniable evidence of Mans fall) From the Byaſs of ſome Intereſt or Concern whereby Men are engaged, or ſome natural propenſity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination they are born with, that oppoſeth and undiſcernedly prevails over the true and genuine iſſues of Reaſon inſlaves them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and ſways the Judgment another way.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63973:49"/>derived that great variety of Judgment and Opinion whereby the World, in all the Ages of it, hath been divided.</p>
            <p>Of this ſecond ſort of acquired and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Principles is Mens aſſent to and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Scriptures, as a Book penned by <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> and being of <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miſsion</hi> from God. 'Tis not of thoſe firſt born Principles of Reaſon, from which we cannot diſſent without an apparent abſurdity, and therefore is not within the compaſs of thoſe firſt praerequiſites to all debate and diſcourſe, and the ſtanding boundaries of all Ratiocination: but, is of ſuch a Nature as admits mens doubts, quaeries and debates about it. And the abſolute poſitive belief of it is not to be impoſed upon any man, but all men reaſoned and diſcourſed into an aſſent to it, upon ſuch grounds as are moſt ſuitable to ſuch a ſubject, and mens ſatisfaction about it. Natural Religion is born with men, and is connate with their Beings, and muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. But all ſupernatural Religion is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed into men, and makes its entrance that way. Though it be true, that in all Sciences there muſt be ſome Principles grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they ought to be no other, nor need to be, then ſuch as are general and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Mankind, and ſuch as lie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63973:49"/>to every mans Reaſon: And not ſuch as are only the property of one party, and are peculiar to men of one perſwaſion. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men (in order to the founding of any Science) lay down poſitions and Principles upon which they proceed, if ſuch Principles be beyond the firſt and common rudiments of every mans Reaſon, though in themſelves never ſo true, yet they ought to be ſubject to debate, and admitted queſtionable in all Reaſonings about that very Science. Not to admit ſome univerſal Maxims, is the way to make Mankind certain of nothing; and to admit any particular mens Opinions, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable Principles, is the way to inſlave the World to every party. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the firſt Principles of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but not of <hi>Men.</hi> The firſt of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but not of all <hi>Science:</hi> And therefore we ought to begin their Proof againſt all <hi>Antiſcriptural oppoſition,</hi> from the <hi>common Notions</hi> of <hi>every</hi> mans <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and from thence induce an aſſent to their <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Sacred Authority;</hi> which we ſhall find God has made ſufficiently evident to a rational and impartial inquiry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Teſtimony given by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men, to the Truth of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (though it be the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63973:50"/>moſt convincing Evidence that can be given to them, and that way God is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to himſelf of giving men an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſatisfaction about that, and all other Divine things yet) 'tis not to be urged in proof of the Scriptures, againſt its profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Adverſaries: And that upon two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the bleſſed Spirit it ſelf is not a <hi>common</hi> demonſtrable Principle amongſt Mankind, and ſo cannot be made uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that know no ſuch Teſtimony, nor admit the being of any ſuch Principle. Nothing but what a man does aſſent to, can with any good Reaſon, be urged upon him to prove what he does not aſſent to. To go about to prove the <hi>Scriptures</hi> by any Evidence ariſing from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> muſt needs be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abſurd; becauſe there is no other way to prove that there is any ſuch thing in Being as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves. So that what I am about to prove, muſt firſt be <hi>admitted</hi> before I can make good the exiſtence of that <hi>Medium</hi> I take to prove it by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whatever Evidence the Holy Ghoſt gives to any man, to aſſure him of the Truth of any propoſition, that Evidence, as ſuch, can never go beyond <hi>his own Breaſt,</hi> nor
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63973:50"/>can I ever prove any thing by it, as it is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and infallible Evidence; becauſe ſuch Evidence is no way Communicable to another but in an ordinary way. Nothing is viſible to another in ſuch caſes, but the Reaſons I can produce. The Divine illumination I have within my ſelf to convince me that ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are Cogent and prevailing, can never be ſo demonſtrated as to convince another that has no ſuch illumination. The illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Ghoſt in the Minds of Men are no other way to be conceived of, then that he is pleaſed to propoſe the right Grounds and Reaſons upon which things are to be believed, and to convince and ſatisfie the underſtanding that they are ſo, and to bring men to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in Concluſions by aſſertaining them of the Truth of the Premiſes. 'Twere <hi>Heterodox</hi> and falſe, and one of the worſt ſorts of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſme,</hi> to ſay, That Divine illumination were not always accompanied with rational Evidence. And that any thing were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the Minds of Men, for which no Reaſon could be given, 'twere moſt unſuitable to a reaſonable being, and moſt contrary to the manner of Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Men; all the intercourſe between God and Man being maintained by the trueſt exerciſe of our rational faculties, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63973:51"/>Whoever reſts aſſured from a Divine Teſtimony of the Truth of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as coming from God, may deal with an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcripturiſt</hi> by thoſe <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> upon which ſuch Teſtimony is built: But will vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and to no purpoſe urge that ſatisfaction he receives of the validity of ſuch Grounds and Reaſons from ſuch a Teſtimony, when that <hi>Teſtimony</hi> can be no further made <hi>Evident</hi> then by ſuch <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> as he is able to produce for it, of the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of which every <hi>other</hi> Mans Reaſon, in an ordinary way, muſt neceſſarily be the <hi>Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this preſent undertaking, there ought alſo to be this praeliminary Conſideration, that as there are <hi>divers Things</hi> of <hi>divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> true, ſo there are <hi>various ways</hi> of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Truth of them <hi>Evident,</hi> and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums of proof proper and peculiar to each. This is viſible in <hi>Aethicks,</hi> in <hi>Phyſicks,</hi> in <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and in all other <hi>Sciences.</hi> When we diſcourſe of the <hi>Bible,</hi> divers things will come in queſtion, the Truth of which, by <hi>various Mediums</hi> of proof muſt be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Firſt, in the general, whether it be reaſonable to believe that there ſhould be any ſuch <hi>Supernatural Law</hi> as this, ſent from Heaven or no! This is to be cleared from the exerciſe of our own Reaſon, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63973:51"/>principles of ſuch natural Religion as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is born with. Secondly, whether this Book, as 'tis now propoſed to us, be, in the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, ſuch as is <hi>likely</hi> to come from God, and to be that Law by which the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Maker of all things would <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> the World! This muſt alſo be cleared from that <hi>Natural Divinity</hi> that lodges in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mans own Breaſt, and thoſe primary No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God and Religion, which all unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Reaſon aſſents to, and which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently ſuppoſed to all diſcourſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and whatever is Supernatural. Thirdly, whether this Book was written by <hi>thoſe Perſons</hi> whoſe Names it bears, and in thoſe <hi>Times</hi> wherein it avows it ſelf to be written! Whether ſuch Miracles were wrought! ſuch Praedictions fulfilled! All things of that Nature (being matters of fact) muſt be proved to us by <hi>credible Teſtimonies,</hi> and by ſuch means as can aſcertain us about a matter of fact, and a thing long ſince paſt. He that demands to be ſatisfied about a matter of <hi>fact</hi> long ſince paſt, and yet denies to acquieſce in <hi>Hiſtorical Evidence,</hi> is ſo abſurd, as at the ſame time to propoſe a <hi>Doubt,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves againſt all way of <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Fourthly, whether this Book, as now we have it, be the <hi>ſame</hi> it was when it was <hi>firſt written!</hi> and have
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63973:52"/>not been ſince <hi>corrupted</hi> or <hi>changed!</hi> The proof of this depends upon what may be rationally urged to make it credible, That this Book ſhould ſtill be ſecured by a <hi>Divine care,</hi> and to render the ways and means Hiſtorically Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by which ſuch a Divine care, in all Times and Ages, hath been exerted. And ſo, in all other things that may be in doubt about the <hi>Bible,</hi> there are proper induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to our belief (as will appear hereafter) and ſuch as the Nature of ſuch a ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. And he that will not acquieſce in a belief of things upon the Evidence they are <hi>capable</hi> of (though perhaps, not ſo full and convincing as ſome other things will afford) declares himſelf to be obſtinately <hi>willful</hi> and abſurd. Nothing can now be urged in proof of the <hi>Bible,</hi> that will come under any ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble demonſtration. The propoſal of this Book to the World to be received as a <hi>Law Divine,</hi> is not ſo made as by <hi>Mathematical</hi> Evidence, or groſs viſible abſurdities in its denial, to introduce it ſelf irreſiſtably at the firſt ſight. But this book is ſo propoſed to our belief, as that all men, by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impartial conſideration of the matter of it, and a due enquity into all the Circumſtances attending it, may have ground ſufficient to acquieſce in it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63973:52"/>as <hi>Divine,</hi> and judge it to be ſuch as it ſelf claims to be.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Bible</hi> ſhould be upon ſuch terms and no other propoſed to the belief of the World, ſeems highly reaſonable, when we conſider that God intends this book as the great <hi>SHIBBOLETH,</hi> by which he will <hi>try</hi> the World; that from the believing or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of it, ſhall ariſe the great <hi>diſcrimination</hi> between Virtuous and Good Men, and ſuch who free from the prevailing influence of corrupt and ſenſual Intereſts purſue the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine dictates of right <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> thoſe notions of <hi>Divinity</hi> they are born with, and <hi>others</hi> who either chooſe to be <hi>Sottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ignorant,</hi> or elſe <hi>wilfully</hi> to <hi>oppoſe</hi> what God had made in it ſelf moſt ſuitable and correſponding to the Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of every unprejudiced Man. The truth is, our <hi>Aſſent,</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> to the <hi>Bible,</hi> is made a matter of <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> And therefore 'tis ſo propoſed to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that there may be a ſufficient <hi>ground</hi> for <hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The way to this Diſcourſe in hand being thus far cleared, I ſhall now proſecute the deſign of it, in this method. Firſt I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to render it a thing reaſonable to be believed that there <hi>ſhould be ſome ſupernatural
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63973:53"/>Law</hi> revealed from God and given to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (in order to their preſent and future happineſs) as the great <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of all their actions towards God and towards each other. And that 'tis not a reaſonable ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal that the world, in the poſture we find it, ſhould be left ſingly to the conduct of <hi>Nature.</hi> Secondly, That 'tis moſt rationally credible, upon all ſuch grounds by which a judgment in this caſe ought to be eſtabliſhed, That <hi>this Book</hi> we call the <hi>Bible</hi> is <hi>this Revealed Law</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to our natural Light, and contains in it ſelf that <hi>compleat Syſteme of Divine Truth</hi> by which God will <hi>Informe, Rule,</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> the World. And this I ſhall endeavour a proof of, from the <hi>matter</hi> of this Book it ſelf, and from ſuch external concomitants of it, as highly concur to create a belief of its <hi>Divine Authority.</hi> And laſtly, propoſe all ſuch conſiderable <hi>Doubts, Queries,</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> as the minds of men are uſually buſied withall about this Matter. And attempt their <hi>Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>To make the firſt thing propoſed evident, that 'tis Reaſonable to believe, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that God <hi>ſhould</hi> give us ſome <hi>further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> then what our Natural Light will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us: That he ſhould promulge ſome <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Law</hi> to the world: Let theſe ſeveral
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63973:53"/>things following be duely conſidered. Firſt, What wretched and diſmal <hi>Ignorance</hi> has the world been in, yea the wiſeſt and beſt parts of it, and in what <hi>diſagreement</hi> with it ſelf about all parts of <hi>Religion,</hi> where this ſupernatural Law hath been either not <hi>known</hi> or not <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved!</hi> How ſadly hath that inbred principle of Religion wherewith all men are born, been ſeduced and miſlead, where there has been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſupernatural to guide and direct it! The natural notion of a Deity has corrupted into all folly and vanity, and men have formed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions not only hateful to God, but at laſt nauſeous to <hi>themſelves.</hi> Devotion, men ſtill had, to <hi>ſomewhat above them,</hi> but they knew not well how to expreſs it. The Wiſeſt ſaw reaſon enough to <hi>ſcorn</hi> their own <hi>Religion,</hi> but knew not how to compoſe a better. Some went farr in the <hi>Negative,</hi> in ſaying what ought <hi>not</hi> to be, that then was, amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but none ever attained to a certain <hi>directory</hi> of what <hi>ſhould</hi> be. When we view over the utmoſt products of all humane abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the greateſt diſcoveries at any time made by natural light, we ſhall find the world without Revelation to have been greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in theſe three things. Firſt, in their <hi>Divinity,</hi> in their conceptions of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and their <hi>Worſhip</hi> of him. Secondly, In the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63973:54"/>account they gave to themſelves of the worlds firſt <hi>Production</hi> and of the <hi>Origine</hi> of things. Thirdly, In their <hi>Morality,</hi> and in their <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtitutes</hi> of humane life, and the converſe of mankind together. Firſt, In their <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Varro</hi> ranks all the Heathen <hi>Theology</hi> under three heads, Their <hi>Fabulous</hi> and <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Theologie, Their <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Myſtical</hi> Theology, Their <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which he alſo calls <hi>Mythical, Phyſical,</hi> and <hi>Civil.</hi> The firſt came from their <hi>Poets,</hi> and contains ſuch a <hi>Rapſody</hi> of <hi>Nonſenſe</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> as the like to it hath not, upon any occaſion, nor upon any ſubject, been collected ſince the world began; That one God was born from a <hi>Mans Head,</hi> another from a <hi>Mans Thigh,</hi> a third from ſome <hi>drops</hi> of <hi>Blood.</hi> That ſome Gods were <hi>Thieves,</hi> others <hi>Adulterers,</hi> others <hi>Servants</hi> to <hi>Men,</hi> with multitudes of ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous fictions. The Second ſort came from their <hi>Wiſe men,</hi> and from their <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> They diſpute <hi>what</hi> the Gods are! <hi>Where</hi> they are! And <hi>whence</hi> they are! And amongſt them, we find an endleſs diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and moſt ſtupendious folly; ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the gods to conſiſt of <hi>Fire,</hi> ſome of <hi>Numbers,</hi> others of <hi>Atoms,</hi> and by their My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Divinity interpreting <hi>Jupiter</hi> to <hi>Fire, Juno</hi> to <hi>Earth, Pluto</hi> to <hi>Air, Neſtis</hi> to <hi>Water,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:63973:54"/>and others of their Gods to the ſeveral parts of the World, with many other ſo groſs and notorious abſurdities, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells the <hi>Graecians</hi> that <hi>the Divinity of their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Multo ſit quam Poctarum Theologia at<expan>

            <p>That we call <hi>Learning</hi> (which is nothing elſe but acquired Knowledg reſulting from the improvement of our rational faculties) if we conſider its riſe, 'tis not to be doubted but that the ſeveral parts of it had their firſt preductions from the Nations the <hi>Graecians</hi> caled <hi>barbarous,</hi> and were begun amongſt them as the poſition of each Countrey, and the inclination of each people variouſly led to them.

To make the <hi>Graecians</hi> the firſt Authors of it, as ſome do, and to derive it originally from them, is to abuſe the World with a falſe and fictitious pretention, as if all the rational part of the World had been in a Lethargie but themſelves, and all mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals had lain in a Trance, and been firſt awakened in <hi>Graece.</hi> 'Tis true, that what lay ſcatter'd in ſeveral hands, was their firſt eminently united, and greatly improved by the ſingular abilities and induſtry of their <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers;</hi>

The whole of the <hi>Heathen Divinity</hi> having been, ſome way or other, tainted, and is reducible to one of theſe three heads, either <hi>erroneous, uncertain,</hi> or <hi>imperfect.</hi> Moſt of it <hi>erroneous,</hi> much of it <hi>uncertain,</hi> but all of it <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we enquire how mankind came to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted</hi> as they have been in theſe things of greateſt concernment, How ſuch a flood of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition</hi> came to overſlow the Gentile-world! Two things ought to be conſidered in order to the ſatisfaction of ſuch an enquiry. Firſt, the <hi>Internal Cauſe</hi> of it, And ſecondly, the <hi>External Means</hi> by which it hath been brought about. The <hi>Internal Cauſe</hi> of it hath layn in two things. Firſt, An <hi>Inſuſſiciency</hi> in our <hi>Natural Abilities,</hi> ſince the <hi>Fall,</hi> to aſcertain us fully about Divine things, and to give a ſatisfying anſwer to all thoſe enquiries we naturally make about
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63973:66"/>them; Secondly, the general ill <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the world has made of thoſe abilites it had, and the univerſal <hi>Declenſion</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of mankind from that knowledg they might have arrived at. For the firſt, Though the Being of God and the exiſtence of a Supreme Power be witneſſed to, by every mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and every man be born with a relation to ſomewhat <hi>Above</hi> him, and there be many Maximes of Natural Divinty connate to the true exerciſe of our rational faculties, yet there be two things can never be attained by any Natural ſearch. Firſt, A certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <hi>What God is!</hi> And Secondly a certain knowledg <hi>How he is to be Served!</hi> Neither a Satisfying account of the Nature of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor of a Worſhip acceptable to him, is to be compaſſed, without <hi>Revelation.</hi> About theſe two things, when men have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing told them from Heaven to fix them, their <hi>Opinions</hi> have been as <hi>various</hi> as their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</hi> The groſſer part of the world (God being onely an <hi>Intellectual</hi> Object, whom they could not <hi>ſee</hi>) generally fell to conceive of him by what they <hi>did ſee. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> himſelf confeſſing that when we come to conſider <hi>Qualis ſit Deorum Natura, Nihil eſt dificilius quam a conſuctudine oculorum, aciem mentis abducere. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Nat. Dear.</hi> And
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63973:66"/>the more Refined part loſt themſelves in a Wilderneſs of Abſtracted Speculations about what they could never diſtinctly comprehend. For the Second, 'Tis plain, a great part of the Heathen Idolatry aroſe, not only from their <hi>Miſtakes</hi> in what they <hi>could not</hi> know, but from a <hi>corrupt defection</hi> from what they <hi>might</hi> know. Thoſe Notices their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural abilities gave them of God, thwarting their Senſual Inclinations, they delighted not to retain <hi>ſuch</hi> a knowledg of God in their minds, but willingly turned aſide to Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, left the guide of their Reaſon, and choſe the conduct of <hi>Appetite.</hi> The Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious folly of their Religions, is as a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes to this Truth, That they lived not only below the true <hi>Knowledg</hi> of the <hi>one God,</hi> but farr beneath the exerciſe of <hi>Right Reaſon.</hi> For though I am apt to believe that a <hi>Supernatural</hi> knowledg does much inſtruct us in the true extent of what is meerly Natural, and does much inkindle our natural Light, and we ſee many things <hi>now</hi> to be attainable by Nature, which the world (ſo farr as I can diſcerne) never found out without Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet 'tis not credible that a Rational Being (without ſome way extinguiſhing the dictates of his own faculty) ſhould make a <hi>God</hi> of that which he himſelf knew to be but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63973:67"/>a <hi>Periſhing Creature,</hi> or ſhould think to pleaſe a <hi>being</hi> of ſuch perfections as every mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt needs aſcribe to <hi>God,</hi> by debaſing himſelf before the <hi>Meaneſt parts</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If we conſider the <hi>External means</hi> by which theſe Internal Cauſes have <hi>operated,</hi> and how all that Rubbiſh of <hi>Pagan Theology</hi> hath been viſibly induced to defile and cumber the world, from five things chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may derive it. Firſt, From a corrupt Tradition of the Worlds firſt <hi>original,</hi> and the Hiſtory of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Flood,</hi> and many paſſages both before and after the Flood, which <hi>Noah</hi> and his family firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed down to the world in its Repeopling, and the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> afterward inform'd them off. This appears to have been a great riſe to many of the <hi>Heathen Superſtions</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> and moſt eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> much of whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> ſeems to be a plain <hi>corruption</hi> of thoſe <hi>original Truths,</hi> and an apparent <hi>Mythology</hi> upon the <hi>True Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> of things before and after the <hi>Flood,</hi> as appears by <hi>Diodorus Sicubus,</hi> and more ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their own famous <hi>Antiquary Sanconiathon,</hi> in the <hi>Verſion</hi> of <hi>Philo Biblius.</hi> The occaſion of which corruption in the Tradition of thoſe things was, probably, the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of <hi>Tongues</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:63973:67"/>at firſt, the great increaſe of <hi>Barbariſme</hi> after, the proud deſire every Nation had to apply all Traditional Stories of famous perſons to ſome of themſelves; with many other Reaſons which <hi>Scaliger, Bochart,</hi> and other Learned men give for it. Secondly, From the <hi>Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Poets,</hi> who 'tis clear, were the firſt beginners of all the <hi>Graecian Learning,</hi> and were therefore anciently called in <hi>Graece</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Teachers,</hi> and as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſays (and I thinks, upon very good grounds) were alſo the firſt beginners of all the ancienteſt Learning every where. All other <hi>Speech,</hi> whether <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> or <hi>Rhetorical,</hi> being but the progeny of <hi>Poetry,</hi> the Ancients knowing no other artificial or ſet form of ſpeech but what was in <hi>Verſe;</hi> and therefore, as the ſame Author ſaies, <hi>Poetry</hi> was anciently called <hi>Prima quaedam Philoſophia.</hi> Theſe fill'd the World with innumerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>Mythologized</hi> upon every thing, and did greatly promote their <hi>Theological Vanities</hi> and the <hi>Corruption</hi> of all true <hi>Story.</hi> Thirdly, From the wild Speculations and multiplied <hi>Theories</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> (of whom there were ſome hundreds of <hi>Sects</hi>) which ſerved greatly to <hi>Puzzle</hi> and <hi>Miſ-lead</hi> men. There being, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaies, no <hi>Abſurdity</hi> but had ſome <hi>Philoſopher</hi> for its <hi>Patron.</hi> Fourthly, From their <hi>Oracles,</hi> by which the world lay
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63973:68"/>ſubjected to all <hi>Diabolical deluſions.</hi> And fifthly, from their <hi>corrupt Legiſlators,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Numa</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and others, who finding the World <hi>Sequacious</hi> in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> and Mankind apt to <hi>adore</hi> every <hi>fiction,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon their belief whatever they thought moſt conducing to their own <hi>Politick Ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor has the World without <hi>Revelation,</hi> been free from defects in its <hi>Morals,</hi> though Men attained far therein, and their <hi>Morality</hi> much outwent their <hi>Divinity. Cicero</hi> wrought with much better ſucceſs <hi>de Officiis,</hi> then he he did <hi>de Nat. Deorum,</hi> yet the <hi>Bible</hi> has great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved the world <hi>herein.</hi> Let any man extract the moſt exact <hi>Scheme</hi> he can of <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> out of the beſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and the <hi>acuteſt Moraliſts,</hi> and compare it with the Doctrine the <hi>Bible</hi> propoſeth to us about thoſe things, and the defects of it will be viſible. <hi>Amiraldus</hi> obſerves in his Treatiſe of <hi>Religions, That ſcarce can there be found any Common-Wealth amongſt thoſe which have been eſteemed the beſt policyed, in which ſome Grand and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vice has not been excuſed, or permitted, or even ſometimes recommended by publick Laws. Plato</hi> makes a <hi>Community of Women,</hi> one of the fundamental <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of his <hi>Republick. Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> I think are agreed to be two
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63973:68"/>as famous Moraliſts as ever were in <hi>Graece</hi> or in <hi>Rome.

Pride and Self-eſteem was a diſeaſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical amongſt them, and ſeems wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable by any notions they had. Some arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to that impudence to compare themſelves with, nay, prefer themſelves before their own gods. 'Twas either a horrible folly to Deifie what they <hi>Poſtponed</hi> to their own Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimation, or elſe 'twas a ſtupendious effect of their Pride to prefer themſelves before the gods they Worſhipped. Never any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them propoſed the Honour of their own Gods, as the chief end of their Actions, nor ſo much as dreamt of any ſuch thing; 'Tis Evident the beſt of them in their beſt Actions, reflected ſtill back to themſelves, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated there; deſigned to ſet up a Pillar, to exalt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63973:69"/>their own fame &amp; reputation, &amp; to bring home a large Revenue of Glory and eſteem to their own names: eſpecially before the Goſpel was extant, from the light of which 'tis probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Heathen Philoſophers themſelves did in many things rectifie their Morals in after times.</p>
            <p>Nor is it unworthy our notice, upon how much ſafer and ſurer foundations the power of Princes and Magiſtrates is eſtabliſhed by the Doctrine of the Scriptures, then what we find it was by any other Laws. With what poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive indiſpenſable ſtrictneſs is mens ſubjection to Authority commanded! Not the leaſt allowance for any Oppoſition to be made by private men againſt their Superiours.

'Tis neceſſary to ſet up anew upon the ſtock of <hi>Revelation.</hi> Nothing can be more pregnantly urged to ſhew the neceſſity of it, then that the <hi>beſt</hi> and moſt knowing perſons of the World, who have ranſacked all the corners of Nature, and ſeem to have ſet a Copy for ſucceeding Ages to write after, in moſt <hi>Humane attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> have been ſo far from diſcovering the certain tracks to an <hi>Eternal happineſs,</hi> that they were never yet able to frame ſuch a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> as could reaſonably ſatisfie others, or convince the wiſeſt of themſelves, or much leſs upon any good ground be ſuppoſed to find any acceptance with the <hi>true God.</hi> In what
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63973:71"/>ſtrange miſts of Religious Ignorance and folly did thoſe knowing Ages of the world breath out themſelves and expire! making the <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Creatures</hi> their <hi>Gods,</hi> and aſcribing the <hi>vileſt qualities</hi> of the <hi>worſt</hi> men to their <hi>Deities!</hi> Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves in a wilderneſs of <hi>vain Worſhip,</hi> to <hi>She Gods, Wicked Gods, Feigned Gods, Senſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Gods, Many Gods;</hi> How do theſe things point us to the <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> to put an end to the fooliſh Fancies and Inventions of Men! that what man, ſince the fall, could not find out, or had loſt the knowledg of, <hi>God</hi> might acquaint him with, and at once diſcover to him all thoſe admirable <hi>Topicks</hi> of <hi>Divine Knowledge</hi> which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and give him a clear and diſtinct account how the World came firſt to be made! and of thoſe Methods by which Mankind came ſince to be <hi>ſaved,</hi> things beyond all natural kenn, and which only ſerved to reproch the wiſeſt thoughts, and to tell men how little they could diſcover of what they were moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to know. <hi>Moſes</hi> having told us more in <hi>two Pages</hi> then the whole World ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the utmoſt of all <hi>Humane ſearch.</hi> Nor has the world any way improved it ſelf in this kind of Sience to this day.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63973:75"/>ſome <hi>Revealed</hi> Laws ſince. The Foundation of all Worſhip muſt be either in <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Inſtitution.</hi> The Point then to be proved will be this, That God has not by any <hi>Natural Laws,</hi> given to Mankind a ſufficient directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about his Worſhip, and that Intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Himſelf and the World, that (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting either his own Honour or mans Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs) is neceſſary to be maintained, and all mankind naturally tend to: But has left us to expect it in a <hi>Supernatural way.</hi> That God, by a Law Natural, binds us to acknowledg his Being, and has given us ſufficient notices of it in General, and binds us to acknowledg that there is an <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> due to his <hi>Being,</hi> and has given us ſome General Innate directions about the performance of it, I grant: And has alſo obliged us to Live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dictates of our Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which ſhews to us Good and Evil) by that very Nature which becomes Obligatory to it ſelf; In theſe things, our own <hi>Reaſon</hi> is our <hi>Law,</hi> and according to that Law, men without <hi>Revelation</hi> are <hi>Rewarded</hi> and <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> And ſo I doubt not but all the Heathen Nations were. But the Laws of Nature, the dictates of the beſt Reaſon, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with ſuch a plenary direction about <hi>Worſhip</hi> as 'tis neceſſary for us to have, and we
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63973:76"/>all tend to; Nor can any man be a ſufficient Law to himſelf in thoſe things. And that may be thus made to appear.</p>
            <p>All Worſhip muſt either be confined to <hi>Words, Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Bodily Geſtures,</hi> and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Terminated there; or elſe it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſome further expreſſions of Service, by an Appropriation of ſome <hi>other Mediums</hi> unto it. Firſt, No part of the World have ever yet thought it a thing Reaſonable, that God ſhould be no otherwiſe ſerved then by Thoughts, Geſtures, and Words. Both the Principles and Practices of all Nations have, in all times, declared the contrary. Nor has any Worſhip, in any Place, been eſtabliſhed, or ſuch a conſtitution framed as that we call <hi>Religion,</hi> without ſome other expreſſions of ſervice, and ſome other External <hi>Mediums</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to it. And this ſeems to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen from two things. Firſt, Men have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuppoſed their Words, or their Thoughts, or their Geſtures, to be alone, a ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that Homage they are naturally ſenſible they owe to the Greatneſs and Bounty of God, for their own Beings, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this world, which he has viſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon Man, in making the Whole in a ſubſerviency to Him, and giving him the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and quiet poſſeſſion of it; But they ſtill
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63973:76"/>thought themſelves bound to a further expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gratitude and Subjection. Secondly, Mankind in every Age have applied to God under a ſenſe of <hi>Sin,</hi> and of <hi>Guilt</hi> contracted by it, and upon that account, have ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged it as neceſſary to make ſome further <hi>Offering</hi> to God for their ſins, and by ſome other <hi>Mediums</hi> then bare Thoughts and naked Expreſſions, to apply to Him about them. No man ever yet imagined ſuch a ſervice a ſufficient <hi>Compenſation</hi> for <hi>Sin,</hi> but have ſtill attempted a further <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Juſtice above,</hi> and by ſome other ways have indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>appeaſe Divine Anger.</hi> Now, the Reaſon of the world does not iſſue it ſelf into any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive <hi>Certainty</hi> about <hi>ſuch</hi> things, as it does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things in themſelves <hi>Morally Good</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Evil.</hi> No mans Reaſon determines about the poſitive Uſe of any ſuch <hi>Outward Mediums</hi> of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> nor can aſſure me of Gods diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>Acceptance,</hi> in any of them (And, to be upon certain grounds of Acceptance with God, is the chief thing in all our VVorſhip) Nor is any man by Nature, a clear and certain Law to himſelf about ſuch things; Nor is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould; Becauſe there is no Intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Religious Good, as to matter of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in any parts of the world, but all ſuch goodneſs reſults purely from <hi>Inſtitution.</hi> God
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63973:77"/>has not ſanctified any part of the Creation to his Service in ſuch a way by any unalterable obligation ariſing from the Rational Nature. No ſuch External Mediums of Worſhip are founded in <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but all in <hi>Inſtitution.</hi> 'Tis true, the Light of Nature will direct me to that behaviour of my ſelf in the performance of all Worſhip, which I think moſt Decent and Reverent, But for any External Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of Worſhip, the Light of Nature will give me no certain Direction at all. If any parts of the World be to be made uſe of in Worſhip (as by the judgment of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the practice of the whole world, it has been declared Neceſſary that ſome ſhould be) we muſt then, both for the <hi>Choice</hi> and the <hi>Uſe,</hi> of ſuch parts of the World, be wholly guided and ſteered by <hi>Revelation.</hi> And the truth is, every mans own Reaſon is Impregnated with Obligations to a further <hi>Degree</hi> of Worſhip and Divine Homage, then <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf is able to be a Safe and a Certain guide to us in, and directs us to many Duties which we want <hi>Revelation</hi> to teach us how to performe. Which has, in all Ages, made the world ſo inquiſitive after it, and ſhews us how Rationally we tend Upward in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and how greatly our own Natures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us to expect and receive <hi>Inſtructions</hi> from <hi>Above.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Should this be admitted, that Divine Worſhip might be confined ſimply to Thoughts, Geſtures, and Words, yet would not our natural light inable us to acquit our ſelves as we ought in this matter, nor well to perform ſuch a ſervice as that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupernatural help. There be two great ends of all worſhip, which though inſeparable in their attainment, are yet diſtinct in their application, and if not attained, the whole of mens attempts that way will prove altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs and fruitleſs. Firſt, in a right manner to give to God the <hi>Honour</hi> due from us to him. And Secondly, to provide ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for our own <hi>welfare,</hi> by an <hi>acceptance</hi> with him. For the Firſt, how can we Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, with the Honour due to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we have a right <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him, and ſuch a diſcovery of his Being as may fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and aſcertain our minds about him; which we never can have, nor to this day the World never had, without <hi>Revelation.</hi> 'Tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Honour God as we ought, unleſs (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our meaſure) we know him as in truth he is; and 'tis equally impoſſible to know what God is, unleſs it be told us by himſelf. 'Tis not ſimply ſufficient to <hi>Capacitate</hi> me for a due addreſs to the Deity to know in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that there is a Supreme Wiſdom, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63973:78"/>and Power above me, that ſome way or other exiſts (which is all my Reaſon will tell me) but I muſt have ſome <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct</hi> Knowledge of that Being, wherein all thoſe Attributes do exiſt: Upon which, as the Object of my Worſhip, my mind may ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and without which I ſhall be ſure to form an <hi>Idol</hi> to my ſelf in the room of that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and then apply thoſe Attributes to <hi>It.</hi> To which fatal miſtake and Idolatrous deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World (having by Nature, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain account what God was, not after what manner the Deity did exiſt) in all Ages, has been too apparently ſubject. Secondly, how can we ſufficiently provide for our own wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, unleſs we can be ſafely aſſured of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſin, and the total removal of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral guilt: And how is it poſſible to be ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unleſs we knew the <hi>Terms</hi> of Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and the <hi>Means</hi> of our Reconciliation, to him? Of which we have no certain ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account given us by any dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor can they ever be found out, until they be told us from above. Men muſt needs make ſtrange <hi>Prayers,</hi> and have very wild and uncertain <hi>Meditations</hi> about God and their own Conditions, that were benighted with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in ſuch things. <hi>Prayer</hi> and whatever elſe is it ſelf a part of Natural worſhip, would
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63973:78"/>be very <hi>lamely</hi> performed, without ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to guide it. The <hi>Pagan devotion</hi> was a <hi>medley</hi> of <hi>ſtrange Sentiments</hi> founded in horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ignorance of God, and of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the way of mans Reſtoration. Had <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or the wiſeſt amongſt them but left us a <hi>Liturgy</hi> of their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it would with great effect have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us what neceſſity there is of ſome <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to guide even the beſt underſtandings in all Divine addreſſes.</p>
            <p>Two things about Worſhip, the practice of the Heathen World has taught us, beyond all reaſonable denial. Firſt, that Mankind have generally acknowledged it neceſſary that ſome <hi>Supernatural direction</hi> ſhould be given for the manage of that intercourſe that ought to be between God and Man, and have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the ſhortneſs and defficiency of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wiſdom</hi> about it. And Secondly, that there is no one certain compleat <hi>Syſteme</hi> of Worſhip, that by the light of Nature, Men do uniformly agree in. The one reſults from their conſtant recourſe to <hi>Supernatural enquiries,</hi> and the many <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> pretenſions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. The other, from their great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>diſagreement</hi> amongſt themſelves; for the Pagan world, who were only under the conduct of Naturallight (and had, in truth,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63973:79"/>no Revelation at all, but were ſtill abuſed with the <hi>counterfeit</hi> of it) fell by that guidance into endleſs diverſity in practice, and into a numberleſs variety of opinions, about the right way of ſerving and approching the <hi>Deity,</hi> and were univerſally engaged in multiplied Mediums and Methods of worſhip, no way preſcribed by any Natural Law connate with Mens beings, or any general uniform iſſues of right Reaſon; nor indeed were they under any direction at all, either for their Choiſe, or their Uſe, further then what their own <hi>fancies</hi> or beſt <hi>gueſſes,</hi> or ſome <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters could ſuggeſt to them; which plainly declares, there is not an ability in Nature ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to guide Men in <hi>Divine worſhip,</hi> ſo far as their own devotions do naturally Steer them.</p>
            <p>And we that <hi>indeed</hi> have <hi>Revelation,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by that <hi>Revelation</hi> it ſelf, ſufficiently to know the neceſſity there is of <hi>Revelation.</hi> For we find that God, by his <hi>revealed Laws,</hi> does not only <hi>revive</hi> in general the whole of <hi>Natures Laws</hi> about worſhip, and inſtruct us in the true <hi>Extent</hi> thereof, which he does, and much inlightens our natural Knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (which we find was greatly defective, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven about Natural Duty) and gives us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat view of our Natural Obligations to him,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63973:79"/>and teaches us in a duemanner, how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duties of <hi>Nature;</hi> he does not only do this, not only <hi>rectifie,</hi> but far exceed all natural dictates of worſhip, and induceth much into his ſervice that receives its Virtue and worth ſingly from <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and no otherwiſe. Never ſince Man was firſt made, has God left him ſingly to the Natural Laws of his own Being, for the payment of that Homage he owes him. Even to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocent ſtate, God thought fit to give a <hi>Law Supernatural.</hi> A Law which for the matter of it, had no foundation at all in <hi>Adams Nature,</hi> further then that he was by his own nature generally obliged to do whatſoever God required of him. Much more may we expect it ſince the fall, the whole Method of our Recovery being <hi>Supernatural.</hi> Nor is it fit to be thought that God (who has made man not only under an Obligation to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all moral goodneſs; but has alſo implanted in his Being a deſite of a peculiar and ſupernatural converſe with him, and given him ſuch noble faculties ſo capable of it) ſhould not promulge ſome particular Laws by which he might receive a full and ſatisfying direction for the attainment of it, or indeed, that God ſhould not direct men to the furtheſt approches they were able to make toward him,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63973:80"/>and glorifie himſelf by appointing a way to the utmoſt Homage and Service their rational Beings are capable of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Some things moſt eſſentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Being of all Religion, and to the preſent and future good of Mankind, are not <hi>diſcoverable</hi> but by <hi>Revelation.</hi> And 'twere a barbarous conception to think that God ſhould leave the World wholly in the dark about thoſe matters wherein their greateſt <hi>conceruments</hi> lie. I will not ſpeak particularly of the Nature of God, how indiſcoverable it is without Revelation, and yet how <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be known (according to our capacity) in order to all true worſhip; Mens Ignorance in that particular having evidently been the root of all <hi>Polytheiſme</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> nor what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous dark, abſurd, yea, prophane, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous conceptions the World had of it, without Revelation! Nor will I ſpeak further of the Worlds Original, how uſeful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the Knowledge of it is to us, to be truly informed how our ſelves and all things elſe came firſt to exiſt! What marvellous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to our ſelves and what a natural Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to God reſults from it! which yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends purely upon Revelation, and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it is impoſſible to be attained without it. Nor will I mention thoſe uncertainties the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63973:80"/>World hath been, and muſt (without Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) be ſtill intangled with all about <hi>Death,</hi> to know whether it be a Natural accident! a thing originally appurtenant to Humane Nature, and annexed to our Beings in their firſt conſtitution! or hath been as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or upon ſome other account introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſince! and the many difficulties that will ariſe to our meditation either way; nor will I much inſiſt upon that uncertainty we muſt needs be in, about a <hi>future Condition</hi> after this life, unleſs particularly info<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med therein by <hi>Revelation.</hi> Though my Reaſon will tell me (and it may ſafely be collected from the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſpoſition of rewards and puniſhments here) that there is ſome future eſtate of things beyond this World, without a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of which I muſt either depoſe God from his Government, or elſe admit him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, both which are abſurd, yet how condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is it to all true Religion, and how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the incouragment of Virtue and the ſupreſſion of Vice to be fully informed about theſe things, and not to be left fluctuating about with every blaſt of uncertain gueſs and conjecture! What wild conceptions had the Heathen world about their Infernal Regions, and their <hi>Eliſian</hi> Fields! Nor were they only fictions peculiar to the Poets, but admitted by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63973:81"/>their <hi>Wiſeſt men,</hi> and beſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who were able to frame very little better <hi>Ideaa's</hi> of thoſe things. To give one Inſtance of many, <hi>Plutarch</hi> one of the wiſeſt and beſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, in the Treatiſe he wrote upon this <hi>Motto,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>gitated with their own Exorbitant Paſſions; Which was a moſt effectual way to baniſh out of the World all Fear of Vice, and all Love to Virtue, which even by thoſe Obſcure notions they had of a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63973:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>Future State, was much upheld and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But to go farther, How neceſſary muſt we needs grant it, to have the certainty of a Future condition after this Life, eſtabliſhed by <hi>Revelation,</hi> when we conſider how Unfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of the Wiſeſt have been, about the very Being of any ſuch thing at all! Such men as <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> were Doubtful and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved in the caſe, and came to no more but <hi>That they inclined to that opinion, and judged it the more Probable.</hi> And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſcourſed of it with much more Obſcurity. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> of mens <hi>Bodies</hi> is a thing of farr Harder belief, ſtands in greater need of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> to credit it. 'Tis not the eaſieſt task to poſſeſs men with a through perſwaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>It,</hi> when <hi>'tis revealed. Saduciſme</hi> is a weed very apt to grow, and not ſoon <hi>Eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</hi> We find St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſufficiently Laughed at, at <hi>Athens</hi> for Preaching the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> 'Twas a <hi>New notion</hi> to the <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> And yet if there were any Glimmerings of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt any of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who were one of the Sects he encountered. I know, there have been ſome remote apprehenſions amongſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> tending this way: But neither the <hi>Pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>world</hi> in General, nor any conſiderable part, nor indeed any part of it at all, ever agreed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63973:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>in a poſitive diſtinct belief of any ſuch thing. Some fancied there would come to be ſuch a <hi>Revolution</hi> of the Heavens, as that all the <hi>Stars</hi> would be preciſely returned to the very exact <hi>Punctum</hi> in which they were when all things began firſt to be, and that then all that ever had been ſhould return, in Order, Time, and Nature, to their former Condition and Station, and be juſt as they had been. Some tell us, the <hi>Magi,</hi> who were the <hi>Caldaean Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> had ſome obſcure notions that all men ſhould, one day <hi>revive,</hi> and become <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</hi> And ſome of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> thought ſhould be burnt to <hi>Aſhes,</hi> and then would follow an immediate <hi>reſtoration</hi> of all things. But theſe were but wild and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oveing Gueſſes in general; no certain determination was Mankind able to make about this matter in particular. And yet, of how great uſe is the aſſurance of it to all the ends of Virtue and Religion! and how Sovereign a remedy is it againſt the <hi>terror</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>the terribleſt of all Terrors,</hi> to be aſſured, upon ſafe grounds, our <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhall be <hi>raiſed</hi> again, and all the <hi>Friends</hi> we part with here ſhall, in their Souls and Bodies Re-united, <hi>Exiſt</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>But waveing the proſecution of theſe, there be two things in themſelves of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63973:82"/>to the being of all Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all poſſibility of a Natural diſcovery, from whence I ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate the neceſſity of a <hi>Revelation,</hi> in order to the preſent and future happineſs of Mankind. Firſt, a certain diſtinct Knowledge how that <hi>Evil</hi> we find in Mankind came firſt to Exiſt! whence the <hi>Corruption</hi> of Humane Nature came! In ſhort, how there came to be ſuch a thing as <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> in the World! Secondly, how Sin (and Guilt, ariſing from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of it) may be <hi>removed,</hi> and Men brought to a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> with God! and an inward Acqueſcency about it! For the firſt. That there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> in Men, and <hi>Guilt</hi> reſulting from it, needs no proof; every mans own Reaſon determines the Caſe, and the whole tranſaction of the World is too ſad an Evidence of. We find in the Prayers of all Nations a <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of <hi>Sin:</hi> And no worſhip but ſome way or other tending to the <hi>removal</hi> of it; which is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick proteſt in the Caſe, entered by the whole World againſt themſelves. 'Tis viſible, our Inferiour faculties do combate our Superiour, and our <hi>Wills</hi> over Rule us to that which our own <hi>Reaſons</hi> determine againſt. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the end of the laſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of his firſt Book of <hi>Ethicks,</hi> confeſſeth <hi>There is ſomewhat in our
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63973:83"/>Nature that oppoſeth right Reaſon.</hi> Whatever directions the <hi>Phileſophers</hi> and <hi>Moraliſts</hi> gave to <hi>Conquer</hi> our <hi>Paſsions</hi> and <hi>ſubdue</hi> our <hi>Senſual Appetites,</hi> and to conduct us to Virtue, they are all grounded upon this ſuppoſal. <hi>Hierocles,</hi> a Stoical <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> in his Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Golden ſayings</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> ſpeaks fully and excellently to this point; His words are theſe. <hi>Man</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is of his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inclined to follow the Evil and leave the Good. There is a certain ſtrife bred in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; He hath a free Will, which he abuſeth, bindang himſelf wholly to encounter the Laws of God. And this Freedom it ſelf is nothing elſe but a Willingneſs to admit that which is not good, rather then otherwiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a certain Knowledge of the <hi>Origine</hi> of this we call <hi>Evil,</hi> and a clear diſcovery of the <hi>firſt riſe</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it, is of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to the Being of all <hi>Religion,</hi> and that a Man cannot be <hi>Religious</hi> as he ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, is eaſily proved, and will be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, by a due conſideration of theſe four things. Firſt, how can we acknowledge Gods <hi>Juſtice</hi> in <hi>Puniſhing Mankind,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repining <hi>ſubmit</hi> to it as we ought, unleſs we know whence this Evil firſt came! what <hi>Author</hi> it had! and how, and upon what terms man comes to be guilty of that for
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63973:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>which he is puniſhed! Secondly, how can we be (as we ought to be) <hi>ſenſible</hi> of Gods general or particular <hi>favours,</hi> and adore his goodneſs in <hi>preſerving</hi> us, and <hi>providing</hi> for us, unleſs we be rightly informed of our own <hi>demerits</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi> again him, and that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have <hi>deſerved</hi> a total ruine and ſubverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! which we can never be, unleſs we know the firſt entrance of evil, and the original Cauſe of it. Thirdly, how can we properly addreſs our ſelves to God to <hi>repair</hi> our <hi>ruines,</hi> unleſs we perfectly know how the firſt <hi>breach</hi> came to be made! Laſtly, how is it poſſible, upon reaſonable Grounds to reſtrain Mankind from <hi>Impeaching</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom, Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God in making and Governing the world, unleſs we know the firſt riſe and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cauſe of all the diſorder we ſee! which is not to be known till we come to the <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> of evil and ſin. With what Impatience did Men uſe to reproch God and Nature about it, as if there were a kind of <hi>Malevolens</hi> and <hi>ill will</hi> in the Deity to the happineſs of Men! One ſayes,</p>

            <p>Nor indeed can we well blame the diſorder of mens minds that contemplate the preſent poſture of the World, and are able to give no ſatisfying account to themſelves, how things came at firſt ſo to be!</p>
            <p>And that a certain account of evil in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is impoſſible to be had without <hi>revelation,</hi> will appear very evident. How ſhould any man ever come to diſcover whence that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conflict firſt aroſe between the Will and the Judgment! How a man came to be firſt ſo divided againſt himſelf, one condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the other! No man naturally knows any thing of its <hi>Cauſality,</hi> nor more of it then that it is ſo. How ſhould any man ever find out from whence, or by what means thoſe unrn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts and paſſions, thoſe evil and crooked inclinations that naturally infeſt the minds of men, and are a part of themſelves, that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a guilt in mens own Breaſts, and prove ſo ruinous to others, came firſt to exiſt? What footſteps are there in Nature to conduct us to the firſt cauſe of theſe things? and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that attend them? ſomething indeed we may ſay Negatively of the Origine of evil; but we cannot affirm poſſitively the leaſt thing about it. VVe can much leſs tell how Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind came to be wicked, then we can tell
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63973:84"/>how they came firſt to be! and yet 'tis impoſſible to know that, but by <hi>revelation.</hi> 'Tis eaſie to derive the beings of men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, from ſome Supreme maker (though we can never find out the time when, nor the manner how they came firſt to be made) but we can no way at all imagine from whence to derive the <hi>evil</hi> of their beings, or upon what to father the <hi>Corruption</hi> of humane Nature, nor what <hi>Date</hi> to give it. From a Being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect and good, evil it ſelf could not originally come; that is, Men could not at the firſt be made ſo. That we may ſafely ſay in the Negative to aſſert mans Apoſtacy, however any part of the world may dream o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; 'tis demonſtrable that man is ſome way or other <hi>degenerated</hi> from his <hi>Primitive ſtate</hi> (from the clear evidence of which, if we duly conſider it, reſults the abſolute neceſſity of a <hi>revelation</hi>) 'Tis impoſſible <hi>evil</hi> it ſelf ſhould be <hi>Con-created</hi> with him, and be originally appurtenant to him, as part of him. And 'tis thus demonſtrable, if man had been at the firſt made, as now he is, naturally inclined to evil and Vice, had his inclination to evil as well as to that which is good been Created with him, his reaſon would never have appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the one, and condemned the other; becauſe both natural, and upon equal terms in our
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63973:85"/>
               <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> To condemn any one part of our original conſtitution by another, had been in it ſelf not only unnatural and unreaſonable, but it had been directly to reproch our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and our ſelves, which nothing Created can be ſuppoſed to be ſo Created as naturally to do. Nature (as 'twas firſt framed) could never be ſo divided againſt it ſelf. A man could never have had any Conſcience of evil, nor any remorſe for it; nor could any guilt have been contracted by it, had it been (as now it is) part of himſelf, and at firſt Created with him. 'Tis not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man ſhould judge in himſelf that to be evil, and repent of it as ſuch, which he acted in proſecution of his firſt make.

In ſhort, If we ſuppoſe (which we ought) that Man was Not at firſt created with an Actual principle of Evil in his breaſt, Whence could it primarily Ariſe? And whence ſhould we come to call it <hi>Sin?</hi> and, in the true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reaſon, Determine <hi>againſt</hi> it? It muſt be grounded upon a mans Relation and Duty to God. All conſcience of Evil and Sin which we have in our own Nature, is ſtill with a reference to God, to his Nature, and to his Will, and our Subjection to him. If ſuch a thing then as Evil and Sin (for they are Conjoyned by the Rational Nature) muſt needs ariſe from mans Relative Subjection to God, it muſt be by Oppoſing and Diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Will revealed by ſome Law, And that Law muſt be either Natural or Supernatural;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63973:86"/>If Natural and Created with him, it muſt needs be the Dictates of his <hi>Reaſon:</hi> And 'tis marvellous hard to conceive how Man (while he was intire, and untainted, in the compleat furniture of his firſt make) ſhould (without ſome very violent Impreſſions, or ſome very ſtrange concurrence of Accidents) go aſtray from the guide of his own Reaſon, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſuch a Law as was the chief Ruling part of himſelf. Nor are we able to give to our ſelves the leaſt ſatisſying account of it.

'Twill not be eaſy, in a due manner, to <hi>Share</hi> him <hi>Between</hi> them, And if that we naturally call <hi>Evil</hi> came origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as well as that we call <hi>Good,</hi> from a Being <hi>Eternal</hi> and equally <hi>Supreme,</hi> Why ſhould the <hi>Judgment</hi> of right <hi>Reaſon</hi> in man be ſo much <hi>for</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> and directly <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>Other?</hi> If it be ſo, the <hi>Pedigree</hi> of the <hi>One</hi> is no whit <hi>meaner</hi> nor <hi>baſer</hi> then the <hi>Other.</hi> Nor is it a thing in it ſelf poſſible, to annex that we mean by <hi>Evil,</hi> or <hi>Imperfection</hi> from whence it naturally reſults, to what is <hi>Eternal;</hi>

In ſuch a diſmal Wilderneſs of Ignorance and Error has Mankind wandered about, whilſt they contemplated theſe things; about which upon any good grounds to be aſcertained is (without <hi>Revelation</hi>) utterly impoſſible; nor can we (whilſt Ignorant of the <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>Evil</hi>) ever find out the true Reaſon and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Cauſe of all thoſe <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Miſeries</hi> we find the World poſſeſſed of. 'Tis true, the <hi>Heathen</hi> were deeply ſenſible of the ruinous and ſad Condition of Humane Nature, and the troubleſome revolutions of the World; ſome to ſo great a degree that they thought, as <hi>Euripides</hi> did, that we ought to weep at the <hi>Birth</hi> of our Children, and to <hi>laugh</hi> our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to their Graves; and 'twas uſual with them to fancy Death as a <hi>Preſent</hi> ſent from the <hi>Gods</hi> to the <hi>beſt</hi> men for their <hi>beſt</hi> Actions: So they fancied Death ſent to <hi>Cleobis</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> for their <hi>Piety</hi> to <hi>Juno.</hi> To <hi>Agamedes</hi> and <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonius</hi> for building the Temple at <hi>Delphos:</hi> But they knew nothing how the World <hi>came</hi> into this poſture we find it! either it muſt be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequent of Nature, or elſe the World is under ſome great <hi>puniſhment</hi> impoſed by the Supreme <hi>Judge</hi> of it.

We muſt needs imagine it a wretched conſtitution at firſt, that carry'd in its bowels ſo many diſmal misfortunes. Who can ſuppoſe God ſhould from the beginning frame this World in the poſture we find it? and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the courſe of Nature with all thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows we ſee neceſſarily attending it? We can never reaſonably believe things ſo wrought off their makers hands at firſt, as that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and natural conſequence of them ſhould be their preſent poſture. And if we ſuppoſe (as well we may) all the ſad and ſorrowful accidents, and troubleſome viciſitudes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, to come from a <hi>Judgment</hi> ſince im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed from above; for ſome <hi>Treaſon</hi> of which the World has been <hi>attainted,</hi> and ſome grand piece of <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the great <hi>Sovereign,</hi> how ſhort a Stage will Nature conduct us, in our ſearches after thoſe things!

That which the <hi>Alchoran</hi> tells us in general of the <hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> directly overthrows it ſelf, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> thereby has utterly ſubverted his whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick: For he ſays that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> were <hi>both ſent from God,</hi> and that the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament are Divine Books,</hi> that <hi>God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the Law to Moſes, the Pſalms to David, and the Goſpel to Chriſt.</hi> But pretends that as the Goſpel ſucceeded the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo the <hi>Alcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> does the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Now if the firſt be true, I am ſure the latter is falſe, unleſs God can contradict himſelf, which is impoſſible; For both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> have delivered very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctrines directly <hi>Contrary</hi> to <hi>His.</hi> The <hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>Alchoran</hi> are ſufficiently <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent.</hi> And therefore wherever the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are acknowledged to be <hi>Books Divine,</hi> and from <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Alchoran</hi> ought, reaſonably, to be Rejected as a Vile and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Deluſion.</hi>

            <p>If it be asked, as uſually it is, How that <hi>Religion</hi> came to <hi>ſpread</hi> ſo <hi>far,</hi> and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples thereof to be ſo <hi>Numerous,</hi> if it be ſo <hi>Vile,</hi> and alſo ſo abſurd a <hi>Couzenage</hi> as indeed it is! Such a Queſtion will be eaſily anſwered if theſe Three things be conſidered. Firſt, The <hi>Mahometan Religion</hi> ows its original to the <hi>Sword,</hi> more then to all its pretences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. 'Twas <hi>Mahomets</hi> being a <hi>General</hi> that made him paſs for a <hi>Prophet.</hi> Nor was his <hi>Alchoran</hi> at firſt received in any Nation where his Sword did not make way for it. 'Tis a Religion that was at firſt <hi>Introduced,</hi> and has been ſince <hi>Propagated</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pheld</hi> purely by <hi>Force.</hi> Not <hi>Diſcourſed into</hi> men, but <hi>Impoſed upon</hi> them. <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf often declares that <hi>God did not ſend him to convert the World by Miracles, but by the Sword and by Inſtruments of War.</hi> And indeed, There is not a <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his <hi>Alchoran</hi> where he does not preach <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword, Warrs</hi> and <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> for the advancement of his Law. Secondly, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that <hi>Religion</hi> is introduced, all <hi>Inquirie</hi> into it is abſolutely forbid, and men are <hi>Made,</hi> (without the leaſt <hi>Taſting</hi> or <hi>Chewing</hi>) to <hi>Swallow</hi> the whole <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Mahomets Divinity</hi> at <hi>Once.</hi> And by this means, <hi>Ignorance</hi> is grown ſo natural an Appurtenant to that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> that wherever 'tis ſetled, it does not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63973:95"/>only ſilence all Diſcourſe of <hi>Divinity,</hi> but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ruines all <hi>Learning,</hi> and brings men into perfect Enmity with all <hi>Liberal Sciences.</hi> 'Tis an eaſy thing to ſpread the <hi>Baſeſt Metal</hi> as well as the pureſt, if we can prevent its <hi>Trial.</hi> Falſhood and Truth are upon <hi>Even termes,</hi> where all <hi>Reaſoning</hi> is <hi>Forbid.</hi> And, as <hi>Vives</hi> well obſerves, (diſcourſing of this <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Tyranny) Tutum mentiendi genus eſt, Nolle rationem corum quae dicas reddere. 'Tis a ſafe and ſure way of Lying, to reſolve to give no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for what we ſay.</hi> As nothing is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of Truth and that rational Reception it bids for, amongſt mankind, then this principle, ſo nothing can be more Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the introduction of all Errour and Deceit, then to <hi>Compel</hi> men to lay by, as uſeleſs, their own Reaſons, and vield up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by an implicite ſubjection to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſuch notions as others provide for them. Thirdly, 'Tis a Religion that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Incourages men in the proſecution of <hi>Senſual Satisfactions,</hi> Say: <hi>Mahomet</hi> to his Diſciples, <hi>Avenge your ſelves of your Enemies, and take as many Wives as you will, to propagate the Sectaries of Mahomet.</hi> A ſure way to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige the corrupt part of the World, and by which the <hi>Devil out-numbers Chriſt.</hi> He himſelf Practiced accordingly; for his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63973:96"/>deny not but that he took <hi>Wives</hi> at his pleaſure, and ſometimes <hi>other mens:</hi> And then moſt blaſphemouſly introduceth God himſelf ſpeaking as if he had, in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, Married them to him. And indeed, ſuitable to his Doctrines and Practices is the <hi>End</hi> he propoſeth, and the <hi>Heaven</hi> he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hereafter: A compleat enjoyment of all <hi>Earthly</hi> and <hi>Senſual delights:</hi> The <hi>Paradiſe</hi> he deſcribes, being a place where men ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the imaginable pleaſures of <hi>Meats, Drinks, Muſick, Women,</hi> and whatever the luſts of men can deſire. Which ſufficiently declares the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of his whole <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it any way hard to diſcover (if we conſult the time when this <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> compoſed his <hi>Alchoran</hi>) out of what <hi>Dunghills</hi> much of it was <hi>raked</hi> together. That vile <hi>Pollution</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> by a Licentious <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of <hi>Wives,</hi> he had from the <hi>School</hi> of the <hi>Nicholaitans:</hi> His <hi>Carnal Paradiſe</hi> from <hi>Cerinthus;</hi> That abſurd conceit <hi>that Chriſt did not really ſuffer, but a Fantaſm in his place,</hi> was firſt forged by the <hi>Cerdonians:</hi> That <hi>rage</hi> his <hi>Alchoran</hi> is every where ſtuft with, againſt the <hi>Trinity</hi> and the <hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> came, no doubt, from the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who were famous at that time, &amp; ſome of them his great <hi>Aſsiſtants;</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:63973:96"/>In ſhort, The Religion of the <hi>Alchoran</hi> was at firſt founded, has been ſince propagated, and is ſtill upheld purely by the <hi>Sword;</hi> is in it ſelf ſo wicked, and ſo abſurd a conſtitution, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ſo <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> to the dictates of right Reaſon, that when ever it wants the <hi>Military prop</hi> to ſupport it, if ever it come to be nakedly expoſed to the Teſt of mens Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or to a Trial by <hi>Perſecution,</hi> it being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther founded in <hi>Natural Reaſon,</hi> in <hi>Miracles,</hi> nor in <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pages</hi> of it will ſoon be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> and the whole of it will quickly <hi>expire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return; He that rejects the <hi>Bible</hi> will be eaſily reduced to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either he thinks there is <hi>ſome</hi> Revelation extant from God to the world, or he thinks there is <hi>none.</hi> If he ſay there is <hi>none,</hi> firſt he puts the lie not only upon the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally upon all the Religion that either has been, or is, throughout the world. <hi>Revelation</hi> (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>real</hi> or <hi>pretended</hi>) having been the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal foundation in all Ages, of that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution we call <hi>Religion.</hi> All Nations have reſpectively attributed the <hi>Origine</hi> of their <hi>Myſteries</hi> to their <hi>Gods.</hi> Which though it proves not that the world has generally had Revelation, nor juſtifies any one pretence to Revelation, upon which any one particular
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63973:97"/>Religion is founded, yet it proves thus much, that by the judgment of the whole world there is good Reaſon to <hi>expect</hi> Revelation. And that thereupon Mankind have lived either in the <hi>real</hi> or <hi>Imaginary</hi> poſſeſſion of it. And 'twere ſtrange to conceive that the world ſhould uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agree in the Reaſon and neceſſity of it, and all Nations in all Ages thereupon <hi>pretend</hi> to it, and yet there ſhould neither be, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, any real or rational ground for the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy</hi> of any ſuch thing (for if there were, we cannot then, without impeaching Divine Juſtice &amp; Goodneſs, refuſe in the general to ſuppoſe it) nor the leaſt truth any where in the <hi>fact</hi> of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he ſay there is <hi>none,</hi> he will be forced to confeſs that God (who has made man the <hi>Nobleſt</hi> of all Earthly Creatures, and <hi>Lord</hi> of the world) has left him to a <hi>worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> in the preſent poſture we ſind him, then the <hi>meaneſt Creature</hi> he has ſubjected to his uſe, which is greatly unreaſonable to conceive. The meaneſt Creatures that God has made even to the <hi>Ant,</hi> he has given them a ſufficient ability to attain the higheſt end of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. 'Tis ſo in every Creature beneath the rational beings of men; whatever happineſs they naturally tend to, as their chief end, God has given them an innate ability that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63973:97"/>directs them for the obtaining of it; not is there any defect in the meaneſt Creatures that way. 'Twere ſtrange to ſuppoſe it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with man, that God ſhould not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſtruct him in all things neceſſary for him to know, in order to his higheſt end, and the obtaining of that Supreme good he natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tends to; ſuppoſing him degenerated from an ability he once had, yet we can no way imagine it conſiſtent with Gods goodneſs to leave the whole of Mankind without a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means of Recovery, nor conſiſtent with the great end of Gods Creation, in all the works that he has made. All other Creatures deſire only what gratifies the ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, not what is in it ſelf ſimply beſt. They center in a <hi>ſenſual ſatisfaction</hi> as their higheſt end, and are ſufficiently enabled for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Man by his natural faculty mounts <hi>upward,</hi> reaches after a <hi>higher</hi> and more <hi>Noble</hi> happineſs, a good <hi>above</hi> and <hi>beyond</hi> this world, Man by Nature has an innate notion of a <hi>Deity, a Supreme Being above him,</hi> that has in himſelf all poſſible <hi>Perfection,</hi> is <hi>ſuperlatively</hi> good; The <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of this good, and a <hi>Converſe</hi> with ſuch a being he muſt needs <hi>aim</hi> at; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis the <hi>higheſt Good</hi> his Reaſon diſcovers to him, and in the trueſt judgement thereof the moſt <hi>ſuitable</hi> of all other to the rational

Now, we find <hi>thoſe things</hi> peculiarly to belong to the <hi>Bille,</hi> and that they are no way applicable to <hi>any other Writings</hi> or <hi>Pretences</hi> to <hi>Revelation</hi> whatſoever. And this being ſo (as by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars 'twill undeniably appear to be) where any Revelation in the general, is admitted, the <hi>Bible</hi> cannot with any colour of Reaſon be rejected: And in truth its Divine Authority will againſt all oppoſition be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>

We find not an inſtance where any have ſo far uſurped the Throne of God, as with ſuch an abſolute <hi>ſuperintendency</hi> to dictate to the world. All pretended Revelations have in this viſibly diſcovered their own nakedneſs, and betrayed their own mean deſcent: Not one of them hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been clothed with ſuch a <hi>Divine</hi> &amp; <hi>Majeſtick Authority</hi> as becomes a product of <hi>Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:63973:100"/>and <hi>Power:</hi> and moſt of them no way ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the common <hi>Prudence</hi> of <hi>men.</hi> The Ancient <hi>Heathen</hi> pretences to Revelation were, for the moſt part the <hi>meaneſt</hi> and moſt <hi>trifling</hi> part of thoſe Ages wherein they were extant. And that <hi>Alchoran</hi> which, in later times, <hi>Mabomet</hi> has father'd upon <hi>Revelation,</hi> is a Syſteme of Laws ſo prodigiouſly unſuitable to the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that 'tis, much of it, no way reconcileable to common <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> or any way worthy an Edition from Wiſe or or Good men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> My Reaſon will tell me that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from God to the World muſt needs be ſuppoſed to give us an Account of <hi>all things</hi> neceſſary for us to <hi>know,</hi> and to carry in it a <hi>Compleatneſs</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of <hi>Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> for <hi>all</hi> the great <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> relating to <hi>this life</hi> and a <hi>future.</hi> 'Tis not imaginable that God ſhould make a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> to the world, and not make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate and ſufficient to all the <hi>Ends</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. The great <hi>End</hi> of Revelation is to ſupply the <hi>Deſiciencies</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> (for if Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were in it ſelf perfect and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there needed then no Revelation) and to furniſh mankind with all thoſe neceſſary Requiſites to their own preſent and future happineſs they ſtand in need of, and which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63973:101"/>they cannot otherwiſe obtain. <hi>Adaquate</hi> therefore to our Natural <hi>Defects</hi> ought our expectancy to be in this matter. When a Book propoſeth it ſelf to us as a <hi>Law Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> and containg <hi>Gods mind</hi> Revealed and make known to the World, 'tis a moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable way of Trial, to examine whether <hi>This Book</hi> contain <hi>all thoſe things</hi> I may juſtly expect from ſuch a Revelation, and be ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accommodated to <hi>All thoſe wants</hi> I expect a Revelation ſhould ſupply, and for which a Revelation from God, my own Reaſon tells me, muſt needs be Deſigned. Now, the <hi>Bible</hi> ſtands <hi>Single</hi> in this reſpect likewiſe. No one Book, nor all the Books that now do, or at any time have pretended to Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can anſwer <hi>all the Ends</hi> of a Revelation, beſides it ſelf, or endure ſuch a rational Teſt, but are viſibly Defective and Inſufficient for thoſe ends they muſt needs pretend to be Deſigned. What <hi>Book,</hi> beſides the <hi>Bible,</hi> ever gave us ſo full a diſcovery of <hi>God</hi> as our own rational Nature looks after, tends to, and capacitate's us to receive? What <hi>Book,</hi> beſides <hi>This,</hi> ever gave to mankind a clear and diſtinct account of the <hi>Firſt Exiſtence</hi> of things, and the <hi>Origine</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe?</hi> What <hi>Book,</hi> beſides <hi>This,</hi> ever gave the leaſt tolerable account of the <hi>Origine</hi> of <hi>Evil,</hi> the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63973:101"/>firſt <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Inlet,</hi> with the after-<hi>Progreſs</hi> of it? the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> inflicted for it, and the certain Means to <hi>Remove</hi> and <hi>Obliterate</hi> it? Never any <hi>Book</hi> ſo anſwered that great <hi>End</hi> of Revelation, as to make a full diſcovery to us of the whole buſineſs of mans <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and of his <hi>Recovery.</hi> In ſhort, What <hi>Book,</hi> but the <hi>Bible,</hi> gives us an account of <hi>Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings</hi> with <hi>Men</hi> from the firſt Foundations of the Earth, and has plainly and punctually told us what he <hi>will do</hi> to the end of the world, and for ever? has to the utmoſt diſcovered and ſupplied all our natural Defects, made known to us all that was neceſſary and fit for us to know, pointed us to the furtheſt bounds of our duty to God, and one towards another, and revealed to us plain and direct ways and means to attain the higheſt happineſs here, and the moſt excellent Rewards hereafter our Beings are capable of? No other <hi>Book</hi> can ſo much as make a <hi>pretence</hi> to it, nor, with the leaſt colour, be produced upon this account, in competition with the <hi>Bible.</hi> Did the world afford any <hi>Other Book,</hi> with an equal Pretence, that more fully anſwered all thoſe Ends to which we may rationally expect a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> ſhould be Deſigned, I grant we had good Reaſon to preferr it before the <hi>Bible,</hi> and receive it as ſuch; But if <hi>This
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63973:102"/>Book alone,</hi> and no other, be found to anſwer all the Rational ends of a Revelation, and to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> all the Attainments of Mankind both Moral and Divine, and whatever has made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Revelation beſides, There can be then no Reaſon at all to doubt, but that <hi>This Book</hi> ought to have the <hi>Precedence</hi> of <hi>all others,</hi> And really and truly is, what it ſelf <hi>claims</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All Revelation muſt needs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be correſponding to, and perfective of, the true and genuine Iſſues of our <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light.</hi> There muſt be nothing in it relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, to our ſelves, or to any part of the world, that any way contradicts the <hi>Law Natural.</hi> For that being the <hi>Primary Law</hi> God gave to the world, and which is original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annexed to our Beings, and inſeperable from our ſelves, 'Twere abſurd to conceive (and indeed, upon many accounts, impoſſible to be) that God ſhould ever Repeal either the Whole or any Part of it, but ſtill proceed to Rectify and Compleat it, and Superſtruct all future Revelation upon it. Two things, upon this account, we may reaſonably expect from any pretence to Revelation. Firſt, So farr as it relates ſimply to things Natural, it ought to be juſtified to us by the dictates of right <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and to be a Re-inforcement of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63973:102"/>the Law truly Natural. Secondly, Whatever it propoſeth to our Belief as <hi>Supernatural,</hi> ought to be no way unſuitable to a Rational recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſuch. For though I may well ſuppoſe God to reveale things to me that were <hi>Above</hi> and <hi>Beyond</hi> me, and which my Reaſon could not Diſcover (and cannot refuſe ſo to do, without a Negative upon the great End of Revelation) yet I cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe him to reveal any thing to me that is, in it ſelf, directly <hi>Contradictory</hi> to my Reaſon to believe, when 'tis ſo diſcovered, or uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a rational aſſent to its verity, when in ſuch a way propoſed. Becauſe the deſign of all Revelation muſt needs be in a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> though <hi>Supernatural</hi> way, to Inſtruct and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form mankind. The <hi>Bible,</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, will be found to juſtify it ſelf againſt all exception, and to prevail againſt all competition. Firſt, Not a Syllable in it De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Rational nature; ſome things indeed <hi>above</hi> the full <hi>reach</hi> and <hi>comprehenſion</hi> of it, but no way <hi>Deſtructive</hi> to it; And thoſe ſuch, and in ſuch a way propoſed to our belief, as ought to Enhance and no way to Leſſen our value and eſteem of it; Becauſe 'tis a thing proper and ſuitable to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Greatneſs of God, and that which we ought to expect from him, to bring ſuch
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63973:103"/>things about, and to make ſuch Sublime diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of himſelf to us as may provoke us to <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Adore</hi> as well as to <hi>Believe.</hi> When God diſcourſeth to us of his own Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being, and tells us how the Deity it ſelf does Exiſt, 'Tis a moſt rational thing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, from the nature of the Subject, he ſhould tell us many things that we cannot now <hi>Graſp</hi> in our <hi>minds,</hi> nor fully <hi>Comprehend.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, whenever God reveals himſelf to the world, every mans Reaſon will tell him, 'tis a thing fit to be, That many things ſhould be Received and Believed barely upon the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Gods <hi>Authority,</hi> and juſtified to <hi>us</hi> from their <hi>Author</hi> when they exceed the bounds of our <hi>Comprehenſion.</hi> What reſpect and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence do we otherwiſe, pay to the <hi>Great God,</hi> more then we ſhould do to the <hi>Meaneſt humane Pretender,</hi> to whom we cannot deny an Aſſent to whatever he can Demonſtrate either to Senſe or to Reaſon? And 'tis no way <hi>Contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious</hi> to <hi>Reaſon</hi> to bell us any thing <hi>is,</hi> that is in it ſelf <hi>poſsible</hi> to be, and no way <hi>Unſuitable</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to bring about (when we are told <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of it) but highly <hi>agreeable</hi> to it. Things Naturally and Humanely <hi>Impoſsible</hi> are as <hi>Eaſy</hi> and as <hi>Proper</hi> for <hi>God</hi> to do, and as fuitable to our Reaſon to conceive he that firſt made all things <hi>ſhould</hi> do, as the ordinary
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63973:103"/>actions of men are for them to do. Nothing is a Barr to my reaſonable Belief about <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Operations,</hi> but either what is <hi>againſt</hi> that notion I have of his <hi>Excellent Nature,</hi> or what (to my reaſon) implies a perfect <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in its <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> and ſo is utterly <hi>Impoſsible</hi> to be. The one, my reaſon tells me, God (becauſe of his Infinite <hi>Perfection</hi>) never will nor can do; And the other, it aſſures me, cannot be done. The <hi>Bible</hi> tells us of no one thing (in the higheſt <hi>Supernatural Diſcoveries</hi> it makes to us) but what is, in it ſelf, very <hi>Poſsible</hi> to <hi>be,</hi> Nor of any thing but what ſeems, to our reaſon, very agreeable to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that it <hi>Should be,</hi> and very fit for us to believe (when we are told of God ſo) that it is. Secondly, Never any Book made ſuch a diſcovery to us of what is truely <hi>Natural,</hi> and ſo farr Revived and Reſtored to the truth of themſelves, as this has done, the <hi>Natural Laws</hi> of our own <hi>Beings,</hi> All impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reaſon being Judge. No Humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ever did, or ever could have given Mankind ſuch a proſpect of their <hi>Natural Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> toward <hi>God</hi> and toward <hi>Themſelves</hi> as the <hi>Ten Commandements</hi> have done, or compoſed ſuch a Syſteme of <hi>Law Natural,</hi> or made ſuch an exact <hi>Compendium</hi> of it. None but God that <hi>made</hi> man at firſt, and knew his <hi>Original,</hi>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:63973:104"/>could have ſo farr <hi>Diſcovered</hi> him to himſelf, and retriv'd to his knowledg ſo much of his <hi>Primitive State,</hi> and diſcovered to him, What (by the judgment of his own Breaſt) he ſtill <hi>Ought</hi> to be. The whole of the <hi>Scripture-Religion</hi> (both as it relates to <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>worſhip,</hi> and our performance of <hi>Relative du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to each other) carries in it the Higheſt <hi>Perfection</hi> attainable by our <hi>Natural Light;</hi> And wherein it <hi>exceeds</hi> it, is the moſt <hi>Suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to it, and the moſt <hi>juſtified</hi> by it of <hi>any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> the world has been ever yet poſſeſſed of. What pure and admirable diſcoveries of Gods Excellent <hi>Nature</hi> does it afford us, without the leaſt Savour of what is <hi>Earthly</hi> and from <hi>Below!</hi> So correſponding to a <hi>Rational Idea</hi> of him, that nothing can be more; <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> without the leaſt taint of <hi>Idolatry</hi> or <hi>Superſtition; Rules</hi> of <hi>Holy living,</hi> without the leaſt mixture of <hi>Impurity;</hi> Such Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for our <hi>Behaviour</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> as every mans own <hi>Breaſt</hi> Subſcribes to, as <hi>Juſt, Holy,</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> Indeed 'tis a <hi>Religion</hi> that ſo <hi>perfects Nature</hi> and whatever it reveals that is <hi>above</hi> nature 'tis ſo graffed upon the Stock of our Natural knowledg, and in ſuch a ſuitable way Super-added to it, and ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates with it, as is admitable to conceive, and could be the effect of nothing but an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63973:104"/>Wiſdome,</hi> even of <hi>God</hi> himſelf who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knew what was in Man, and what would be Beſt for him, and moſt Agreeable to him. What juſt cauſe is there to Reject and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim all other Religions upon this ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count! 'Tis impoſſible, That ſhould be a <hi>Law Divine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural</hi> that proves any way <hi>Deſtructive</hi> to what is truely <hi>Natural.</hi> What <hi>Unworthy, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable,</hi> and <hi>Unnatural</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of God and his Being does the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Religion</hi> ſtand juſtly charged withall! How contrary was it to the true dictates of Nature, and the natural <hi>ſhame</hi> inherent in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans being, to uſe ſuch horrible <hi>Obſcene</hi> and <hi>Laſcivious Ceremonies,</hi> as they did in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſome of their <hi>Gods?</hi> How <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>Inhumane</hi> was it to <hi>Murther</hi> each other, and ſhed the blood of Mankind, as they did in their <hi>Sacrifices?</hi> How may <hi>Vices</hi> that Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, grew up under the ſhadow of their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and no way <hi>reproved;</hi> yea, ſome <hi>allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>juſtified</hi> by it! The <hi>Bible</hi> ſpares not <hi>one:</hi> Goes to the utmoſt extent of all natural Evil, and all natural Good. The <hi>Alchoran</hi> alſo falls ſlat before the <hi>Bible</hi> upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. 'Tis ſo far from <hi>perfecting</hi> our natural light, or correſponding with it, that in ſome things it directly <hi>overthrows</hi> it: And is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſtuft with ſuch <hi>abſurd, ridiculous,</hi>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We muſt needs ſuppoſe that a <hi>Revelation</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> a Law Supernatural, to which an univerſal obedience is required, ſhould have ſuch a <hi>Conveyance</hi> to us as is <hi>ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to its <hi>Author,</hi> and that great concern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have in it; that is, 'Twere a moſt irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal admiſſion, that God ſhould reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the world, and not do it in ſuch a way as ſhould carry in it Evidence ſufficient to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rational enquiry. We ought to believe that when God requires our obedience to Laws as <hi>Divine,</hi> he ſhould afford us means ſufficient to know that <hi>they are ſo,</hi> ſuch as may ſatisfie all reaſonable <hi>doubts,</hi> and ſhame all wilfull <hi>Oppoſition.</hi> 'Twere to impeach the Wiſdom, Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, to think otherwiſe. Without this neither Gods end nor mans end can be attained: Not Gods end; for he can never with Juſtice proceed to reward or puniſh men by a Law revea'ed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have notice ſufficient that it is ſo. Not mans end; for 'tis impoſſible to be any way advantaged by a Revelation, as ſuch, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I be firſt aſſured that it is ſuch. How ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſoever pretences to Revelation have been, and mens belief of thoſe pretences, yet
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63973:105"/>no pretence to Revelation but the <hi>Bible</hi> alone, has in any Age been accompanied with ſuch a rational juſtification as we ought to expect a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> ſhould be, to aſcertain us that it is ſo. And of this, the fact is ſufficiently evident: All pretenſions that way have been either recommended to the world upon the credit of mens <hi>bare words,</hi> or elſe have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a reception by means viſibly capable of <hi>deluſion</hi> and <hi>impoſture.</hi> What reaſonable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance had the <hi>Heathen world</hi> of a <hi>Divinity</hi> in their <hi>Oracles</hi> (which yet made the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable pretenſion of any thing amongſt them to it?) 'Tis acknowledged by all that lived in thoſe times, That the <hi>reſponſes</hi> of thoſe <hi>Oracles</hi> were given by perſons <hi>viſible,</hi> and <hi>ſeen</hi> when they did it. In ſome of them by young Virgins, which they ſuppoſed them to receive in a ſtrange <hi>Obſcene</hi> way, not fit to be mentioned; and in others of them by a man whom they called the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one that ſpake under the <hi>Oracle</hi> out of the <hi>Caverns</hi> of the Earth, by the Vapours of which they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him <hi>Inſpired,</hi> and to become an <hi>Enthuſiaſt.</hi> That thoſe <hi>Oracles,</hi> for the moſt part, uttered things <hi>doubtful</hi> and <hi>un-intelligible,</hi> is evident, and ſometimes contrary to Truth; as we may ſee plainly ſet down in <hi>Thucidides,</hi> and other Authors of their own, and which never came to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63973:106"/>paſs (one Inſtance of which was ſingly ſufficient to confute their <hi>Divinity.</hi>) No <hi>Almanack maker</hi> writes with leſs certainty of the <hi>Weather,</hi> then they generally pronounced about future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. And the beſt excuſe their greateſt Adorers made then for them, was, That thoſe <hi>Daemons</hi> that inſpired the predictions, did not themſelves know things future, otherwiſe then by their inſpection of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and ſo could collect from thence but <hi>uncertain conjectures. Plutarch,</hi> after all the pains he has taken to give the world a right account of the firſt <hi>riſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>Oracles,</hi> and the cauſe of their after <hi>ceaſing,</hi> and ſpent much time in diſcourſing whether the <hi>Daemons</hi> that firſt cauſed them were not <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Periſhable!</hi> Or whether they removed not their <hi>Places,</hi> and changed their <hi>abode!</hi> and many things of that Nature: At laſt concludes with this excellent <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, That the true Cauſe of thoſe Oracles was, that the Earth in ſome places was endu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And, at laſt that Virtue, in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Caverns is ſpent, and evaporates and ſo the Oracular Spirit ceaſeth.</hi> What ground had the Heathen for all that Religion they

            <p>Having thus eſtabliſhed theſe two general points; Firſt, that 'tis a thing in it ſelf reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and fit to believe, that there ſhould be <hi>ſome Revelation</hi> made from God to the world, ſome Supernatural Laws promulged as the great Rule of mens lives here, and Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereafter. And that theſe Laws ſhould be ſomewhere or other extant upon Record (that Mankind might be fully aſſured and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained about them, and that they might be viſible to all) that there ſhould be <hi>ſome</hi> ſuch <hi>Book</hi> as the <hi>Bible pretends</hi> to be, and that 'tis greatly unreaſonable to believe the contrary. And Secondly, that in the Judgment of right Reaſon there are many general qualifications that muſt neceſſarily be appurtenant to ſuch a Revelation whereſoever 'tis extant, and by which 'tis but reaſonable that Mankind ſhould make a Judgment of every pretence to it, and that all thoſe qualifications are found punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and peculiarly belonging to the <hi>Bible,</hi> and cannot be applied to any other extant preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Revelation whatſoever. I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, which was a more <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> proof, and endeavour to make it appear that <hi>this Book</hi> is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63973:109"/>indeed ſent us from Heaven, and is in truth <hi>that Revelation</hi> we have good cauſe to expect from above, and that we have all thoſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> concurring to make us acquieſce in it as ſuch, from whence a Judgment in ſuch a caſe ought finally to reſult: That there is ſo much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be given in, to prove its Divinity, as no man ought to deſire, nor can reaſonably expect more, in a matter of ſuch a Nature: And ſo much, that where mens corrupt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and prejudices are not <hi>Predominant,</hi> will appear ſufficient to every impartial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>And this ſhall be proſecuted in this Method. I will theſe ſeveral ways conſider this Book. Firſt, <hi>In the time of its conveyance to the World.</hi> Secondly, <hi>In the way and manner of its convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>In the ſucceſs and effects of it, ſince its conveyance.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>In it ſelf, in the matter of it as we now find it.</hi> And from each of theſe conſiderations will a ſignal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony be given in to its <hi>Divinity,</hi> and when we have taken a view of the whole, we ſhall find that the Book both in the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, and in all the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that have at any time attended it, does eminently relate it ſelf to God as its <hi>Author,</hi> and cannot be reaſonably judged the product of any <hi>Humane contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> whatſoever.</p>

            <p>And this clear Evidence we have (ſo clear, that in ſuch a caſe a clearer cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) of the Antiquity of <hi>Moſes</hi> in point of fact, and the Preeminence of his Writings above all others in that reſpect, gives us very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground to believe, that he himſelf was the firſt introducer of <hi>Letters</hi> as well as the firſt Writer of <hi>Books</hi> (whatever other Nations have fabulouſly boaſted to the contrary, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Plinies</hi> abſurd ſuppoſition; that <hi>Letters</hi> were <hi>Eternal;</hi> becauſe he imagined the World to have been ſo) for 'tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to think if the World had enjoyed

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63973:121"/>to <hi>Truth.</hi> In Religion moſt eſpecially that Maxim prevails, <hi>antiquitate nihil verius, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate nihil antiquius.</hi> In the preſent caſe the Antiquity of the <hi>Bible</hi> carries in it a very ſignal proof of its <hi>Divinity.</hi> That which is the moſt <hi>ancient</hi> Religion, is like to be the <hi>Trueſt;</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>antiquity</hi> in Religion, is an eminent mark of greateſt <hi>Truth,</hi> and that upon theſe two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forcable conſiderations; Firſt, 'tis reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to believe, that there has been an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between God and Man ſince the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and a <hi>Supernatural</hi> inter courſe ſince mans firſt <hi>defection,</hi> that Gods Revelations were as early as mans <hi>neceſſities,</hi> That there was no time wherein man ſtood in need of Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtruction and help, but that God affords it to him. If the ſuppoſal of Revelation in the general be reaſonable, (as I have proved at large it is) the other will follow; and we ſhall find good ground to believe, that there has been a Revelation from God ſince there was firſt Reaſon for it, and ſuch a conſtitution as <hi>Supernatural Religion</hi> in order to mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and recovery that bears an equal <hi>Date</hi> with his firſt <hi>apoſtacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> to think otherwiſe were to deny what the notion of Gods <hi>goodneſs</hi> very openly affirms to us. And this being ſo, no Religion can be <hi>True</hi> that is not clothed with great <hi>antiquity:</hi> And that Religion that is
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63973:122"/>moſt <hi>ancient,</hi> and can derive it ſelf from the <hi>beginning</hi> muſt needs be moſt <hi>True.</hi> The <hi>Bible</hi> therefore giving us Hiſtorically an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Gods <hi>firſt</hi> intercourſe with man, and of the conſtant continuation of it in all Ages, and being it ſelf the <hi>firſt</hi> account that ever was given of Religion in ſuch a <hi>Written</hi> way, upon all accounts the moſt <hi>Ancient</hi> the world has, and in its own <hi>Antiquity</hi> anſwering that <hi>antiquity</hi> we may juſtly expect to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Gods <hi>Firſt Revelations,</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> I ſay upon this account has a ſingular evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given in to its Credibility, and its <hi>antiquity</hi> does ſtrongly affirm its <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> does point us to its <hi>Divinity,</hi> becauſe 'tis not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe that the <hi>Firſt Writen</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the world had of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Cheat,</hi> that the <hi>Firſt</hi> eminent <hi>Record</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Lye,</hi> and not only a Lye but the <hi>Worſt</hi> of Lies, and the moſt <hi>Pernicious</hi> and <hi>Deſtructive</hi> falſhood, (for ſo it muſt needs be to impoſe a Law upon the world in Gods name without his Authority) that ever was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed amongſt mankind. 'Tis not in the judgment of right Reaſon conſiſting with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God to ſuffer the world to be Originally <hi>Cheated</hi> in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63973:122"/>to ſuffer a publick open <hi>Counterfeit</hi> of his <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to the higheſt degree. <hi>Firſt</hi> to poſſeſs the world and take the <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of all truth: to permit the <hi>Devil</hi> to publiſh a Syſteme of <hi>Lies</hi> and erect a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Falſhood, Before</hi> there was any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Record of <hi>Truth.</hi> We muſt needs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Gods care of Men, and the concern's of his own honour, to engage him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that God ſhould <hi>Firſt</hi> eſtabliſh his own Truth, to which mankind might ſtill have a recourſe, and by which as a <hi>Standard,</hi> all <hi>Deluſions</hi> and <hi>Falſe Pretenſions</hi> might be <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> 'Twere, as one ſays well, very abſurd to think God ſhould permit the Devil to ſet up a <hi>Chappel</hi> before he had built a <hi>Church.</hi> If the <hi>Bible</hi> were originally compoſed by <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi> and be not a Divine Book, 'twill then undeniably follow that the moſt <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Ancient</hi> account we have of Religion is <hi>conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,</hi> And that in the <hi>Earlieſt</hi> notices we have of God, of the worlds Original, Mans fall, and the way of his Recovery (for we have none ſo early as what the <hi>Bible</hi> gives us of any of theſe, and of ſome of them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the world is <hi>Deceived</hi> and <hi>Abuſed,</hi> and that God ſuffer'd the Devil in the firſt place, (and <hi>before</hi> any thing was publiquely extant from him to contradict it) in his name and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63973:123"/>with pretence of his Authority, to <hi>abuſe</hi> and <hi>deceive</hi> Mankind with a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>deluſive</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all thoſe things they are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to know, and upon the right Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which their preſent and future happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does unavoidably depend. This very one conſideration will prevail much upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very impartial judgment. Who can believe the <hi>firſt</hi> Religion ſhould be the <hi>worſt,</hi> when <hi>True</hi> Religion muſt needs be as old as the World? And the <hi>Earlieſt</hi> notions of God the <hi>falſeſt,</hi> when we muſt needs think it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that God ſhould reveal himſelf to the World from the <hi>beginning?</hi> Or that the <hi>firſt book</hi> we ſind writ ſhould contain the <hi>Highest impoſture</hi> in point of Religion, and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God and abuſe the World then any or all the Books written ſince? 'Tis a thing beyond all compaſs of credit, That God ſhould ſuffer <hi>falſe informations</hi> to be given in his own Name of himſelf and his own Revelations from the firſt beginning of the World for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4043 years (for about ſo long a time it was from that firſt intercourſe between God and Man the Scripture gives us Hiſtorically an account of till the laſt <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>) And that this account ſhould begin with the <hi>firſt book</hi> that the world had, and be gradually carried on into ſuch a complete Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63973:123"/>as now we ſee it is, in a Written way, by ſeveral hands, in ſeveral Ages, for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundred years together (for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſo long a time it was from <hi>Moſes</hi> his firſt Writing to St. <hi>Johns</hi> Cloſing the <hi>Bible</hi>) Nor is it ſuppoſable that the vileſt <hi>falſhood</hi> for ſuch is the <hi>Bible</hi> if it be not from God (a Religion whereby (if it be falſe) God would be more diſhonoured, and men more deluded then by <hi>any</hi> that ever was yet extant) ſhould have this to ſay in its juſtiſication, <hi>That 'tis of all others the moſt Ancient, and has been longeſt laſting amongſt Mankind.</hi> The conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this <hi>Book</hi> in the <hi>Time</hi> of its conveyance, the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it in reſpect of the matter it contains, and the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it ſelf, as a <hi>Book</hi> written <hi>long before</hi> all others, and of ſo <hi>early</hi> a <hi>Date</hi> in the World, does with great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence point us to its <hi>Divine Original,</hi> and very ſtrongly tends to perſwade us that <hi>God</hi> himſelf was the <hi>Author</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of this Books conveyance to us. The <hi>Method</hi> of Gods thus Recording his pleaſure has been ſuch, that we ſhall find we have all thoſe reaſonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements (and in ſome reſpects more) to credit it, upon which we receive any <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authors,</hi> and acquieſce in them as true: And all ſuch farther Evidence as we can well
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63973:124"/>expect to inſure us of the truth of a Book that pretends to come from God and be <hi>Divint,</hi> And this will appear to be ſo, if we conſider, firſt, the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> God imploied in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, and ſuch humane Circumſtances as attended their doing it. And Secondly, The Divine witneſs <hi>God himſelf</hi> has in the moſt eminent way, given to this Book in its conveyance, to aſcertain us of the truth of it, and of the ſincerity of thoſe that wrote it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we conſider the <hi>Pen-men</hi> of this Book, thoſe <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> God made uſe of for the writing of it, and ſuch Circumſtances as attended their doing it. How unlikely a thing is it that they either did or could abuſe the world in this matter, if we reflect upon theſe ſeveral things. Firſt, the unblemiſhed <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> of theſe Writers. Secondly, the ſeveral <hi>Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> of them. Thirdly, their <hi>Intereſts</hi> as moral and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men. Fourthly, their Number, and that great diſtance of Time in which many of them wrote one from another. For the firſt, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we know does more credit Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, then the <hi>good Report</hi> of thoſe Ages wherein they lived transferred to poſterity. Not one of thoſe Holy Pen-men God imploied in writing the <hi>Bible,</hi> was (that ever we find
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63973:124"/>upon any good grounds) tainted in Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or convicted of any ſort of <hi>Impoſtor</hi> in their own or future ages, but were men of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Integrity and Sanctity in thoſe times wherein they lived, and very many of them gave the higheſt Teſtimony to their integrity, in becoming <hi>Martyrs</hi> in juſtification of what themſelves writ. For the Second, the various Qualities and Conditions of theſe Writers ſeems much to ſecure us againſt ſo vile a deſign as this book muſt needs be compoſed with, if it be not from God. Some of them were Kings, and men of the greateſt quality before they writ, and not very likely to be guilty of ſo much <hi>baſeneſs</hi> and <hi>meanneſs</hi> to carry on ſuch a work, and alſo men of deepeſt Learning and Knowledge: Others of them, many of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were men Illiterate, and of Parts and Education ſo <hi>mean,</hi> that they ſeem no way <hi>capable</hi> to write ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly, to lay ſo <hi>deep</hi> a Contrivement of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, or by the ſingle ſtrength of their own abilities to bid ſo fair to delude the World. 'Twere ſtrange to Imagine men of ſuch diſtant qualities and different abilities ſhould <hi>all agree</hi> in the <hi>ſame Impoſture,</hi> and ſo <hi>Harmonize</hi> as we find they do in the promotion of it. Thirdly, If we conſider the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of theſe Writers as they were <hi>Reaſonable Men</hi> (for ſo we muſt
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63973:125"/>needs ſuppoſe them, and to act upon the ſame inducements that Mankind do in all other things) No man could reap any <hi>advantage</hi> by <hi>counterfeiting</hi> this Book, nor could the Compoſers thereof deſign any <hi>Earthly</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Good</hi> to themſelves as a Recompence for ſuch an undertaking: not <hi>Heavenly,</hi> for 'twere the higheſt <hi>Offence</hi> againſt <hi>God,</hi> and meriting the higheſt <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> Nor <hi>Earthly,</hi> and that upon theſe two Grounds. Firſt, becauſe the tendency of the Book throughout is to <hi>mortifie</hi> mens Earthly <hi>ambitions</hi> and <hi>appetites,</hi> and to propoſe a happineſs of another Nature as mens great <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and relating to another <hi>World;</hi> and no man of common diſcretion that deſigned to greaten himſelf here, would chooſe to become the Author of <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> in order to it; becauſe every ſtep he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced that way would viſibly betray an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy from his own Principles, and render him an open Impoſtor, meriting the ſcorn and contempt of all Mankind. Secondly, The moſt of thoſe that God imploied in that work actually expoſed themſelves by the doing of it to all the <hi>Perſecutions, Hazards</hi> and <hi>Contempts</hi> imaginable; And ſome of them as amongſt the Prophets <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Amos,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and all the Apoſtles (according to what our <hi>Saviour</hi> foretold them) as <hi>Hiſtory</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:63973:125"/>aſſures us, ſave only the <hi>Apoſtle John,</hi> with the <hi>loſs</hi> of their own <hi>Lives</hi> publiſhed their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. 'Tis a thing greatly ridiculous to imagine ſo many men, in ſo many Ages, ſhould <hi>agree</hi> to <hi>cheat</hi> the World to no other end but their own certain <hi>ruine</hi> both in this world and the <hi>next.</hi> What end could many of the Prophets have in thoſe unwelcome Meſſages they brought to thoſe Ages wherein they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and for which they knew beforehand they ſhould meet with ſo much ill uſage? No man can be ſo ſottiſh to think <hi>Jeremiah</hi> deſigned to himſelf any <hi>Intereſt</hi> in this world, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied himſelf into the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> and at laſt into his <hi>Grave.</hi> Or that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> deſigned greatneſs or happineſs here when they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly expoſed themſelves to all the <hi>rage</hi> that was then upon Earth, and endured the ſhock of all that <hi>fury</hi> which either <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> or the whole <hi>World</hi> together could execute upon them. He that reads the Story of St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt needs ſuppoſe him to act beyond the bounds of all folly and madneſs, and not like a man either capable of inſtructing or abuſing Mankind, if he intended any thing in this world as his <hi>End.</hi> The Motives of thoſe Holy Writers in what they did, cannot with any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Reaſon be judged to be other then pure obedience to God, love to truth, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63973:126"/>a Reward <hi>hereafter</hi> above their own lives, and all enjoyments <hi>here.</hi> How highly did they preach up obedience and ſubmiſſion to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, when all the Rulers upon Earth were their moſt bitter Enemies! And that Doctrine could have no other effect but to bring their own Heads to the Block. The Authors of the <hi>Heathen ſuperſtitions</hi> were of a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Genius.</hi> And as one ſayes well of them, <hi>Cute Authores ſuperſtitionis inter Gentes, omnes ſibi &amp; ſuis ſemper conciliarunt Dignitatem.</hi> Nor is there any part of the <hi>Bible</hi> written by any of them with any the leaſt ſhew of intention to greaten or advance themſelves thereby: But on the contrary, many of the moſt eminent of them have themſelves Recorded their own great <hi>fatlings</hi> and <hi>imperfections,</hi> as well <hi>ſecret</hi> as <hi>open:</hi> They all appear to be themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſubjection to the Doctrine they taught (which plainly declares they were inſpired from above) and no way Maſters of it as a Creature of their own. Throughout the whole Book there is a viſible Antipathy to all ſelf-ſeeking, flattery, or compliance: God alone is exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all mens perſons, Actions and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are openly <hi>Poſtponed</hi> to his honour, and put in ſubjection to thoſe Holy and excellent truths there delivered. <hi>Moſes</hi> of all the reſt ſeems the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Fouruthly,</hi> The <hi>Number</hi> of thoſe Writers and the great <hi>diſtances</hi> of <hi>Time</hi> may of them lived in from the other, does as probably ſecure us againſt any Humane contrivement in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of this Book as we can reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. The world affords not an inſtance, that ever ſo many <hi>Men</hi> that lived in ſo many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and <hi>diſtinct Ages,</hi> ſo exactly agreed about <hi>any one thing,</hi> much leſs to <hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and carry it on in ſuch a continued written way: Never any ſuch thing was done in any kind; nor is it ſuppoſable upon the grounds of common Reaſon that ever any ſuch thing ſhould be: 'Twere ſtrange it ſhould be done in a matter of higheſt concernment, wherein Gods Honour &amp; mans welfare are to the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63973:127"/>utmoſt engaged; that ſuch a number of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors ſhould be at ſeveral diſtant times for fifteen or ſixteen hundred years together in contriving and compoſing ſuch a Book as the <hi>Bible</hi> is, to delude and deceive the World, and that in all that time there ſhould be no palpable diſcovery made of them, nor they themſelves ſhould ſo trip in the doing it, as viſibly to ſhame their own undertaking, and betray thoſe corrupt and rotten principles upon which they proceeded.

And yet all this, and all things relating to the <hi>Bible,</hi> have come as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to paſs, as if all thoſe perſons that writ the <hi>Bible</hi> had lived at one time, had all <hi>talked together,</hi> and perfectly agreed the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before one word of it was written. Nay <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſo <hi>explained</hi> and <hi>juſtified</hi> by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and both in ſuch a way explained and <hi>fulfilled</hi> by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles, Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Prophecies</hi> are in ſuch a manner made good, fulfilled and interpreted, as ſeems utterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of all humane skill and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement, ſuppoſing all the Writers had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at one time, had all conſulted together, and with their utmoſt abilities laboured to bring it ſo to paſs. What Humane skill can we reaſonably conceive could have contrived ſuch a gradual fulfilling throughout the whole <hi>Bible</hi> as now we ſee of that promiſe, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head?</hi> What Humane Artifice can we conceive could have contrived ſuch a Prophetical Prayer as <hi>Gods perſwading</hi> Japhet <hi>to dwell in the Tents of</hi> Sem, with ſuch a fulfilling of it, as that after the World had been <hi>Canton'd</hi> (in Ages then to come) into <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> from their poſterity both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were in the higheſt enmity each to other, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate

And indeed no man that is not bereft of his wits can Imagine, that any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Impoſtors could have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of ſuch a projection as the <hi>ſaving</hi> men by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is the main and grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> or could have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch remote obſcure promiſes of it at firſt, and ſuch gradual and ſtupendious fulfillings of thoſe promiſes after. 'Tis not, I ſay, only highly improbable that ſuch a number of men living in ſuch diſtant Ages, ſhould agree to write ſuch a Book; but 'tis unreaſonable to Imagine, that admitting they had ſo agreed, yet that they could have produced ſuch a book as the <hi>Bible,</hi> or that a Book ſo conſiſting with it ſelf, could have been at ſuch remote diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time contrived by the cunningeſt Heads of any wicked Impoſtors whatſoever. Nothing leſs then a Divine and Heavenly Wiſdom could have guided ſo many hands as writ the <hi>Bible</hi> in ſo many Ages into ſuch an admirable agreement, and punctual correſpondency with themſelves. 'Tis not eaſie to find an agreement between men of the ſame ſect and opinion in any one Age, or to find any one man in his own writings, if he write much,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63973:128"/>exactly agreeing with himſelf; But to ſee ſo <hi>many</hi> men, in writing ſuch a Book as the <hi>Bible,</hi> ſo harmonizing together as there they do, is of ſingular conſideration: Throughout the whole Book we find theſe Writers ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and building forward till the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is layed, without rejecting any thing, all things <hi>compleated,</hi> and <hi>fulfilled,</hi> never any thing <hi>denied, Contradicted,</hi> or <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> but we ſtill ſee a rare uſe of every part relative to the whole, and ſuch a fabrick intirely reared, without the leaſt part Miſ-placed, or any cauſe ſeen to entertain a ſecond thought or to Alter. Of which no inſtance can be given in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of any humane Science whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The Harmony we find in this Holy Book is of great Remark, upon theſe three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Firſt, 'Tis a harmony that reſults from exceeding <hi>Different Styles,</hi> and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Matter.</hi> 'Tis not ſo many mens bare agreement together upon any <hi>few plain points,</hi> but tis <hi>ſo many</hi> mens agreeing together who have writ <hi>Hiſtorically, Prophetically, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally,</hi> with wonderful variation both for Matter and Manner of all the <hi>Sublimeſt notions</hi> the minds of men are capable of, as well as of the plaineſt truths, of things in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in <hi>Earth,</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> of all ſorts of things relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and Men, and of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63973:129"/>of this World, and the next. Secondly, 'Tis a harmony reſulting from an involved <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency</hi> of the <hi>parts</hi> one with another, and of every part with the whole (now we ſee it conjoyn d) in ſuch a way, as could not be foreſeen or contrived by any humane wiſdom in the writing of any <hi>one</hi> diſtinct part. There is in the <hi>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The more <hi>experience</hi> we have of this Book the more we find it at <hi>unity</hi> with it ſelf, and the more we <hi>ſearch</hi> into it the deeper <hi>harmony</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:63973:129"/>ſtill we diſcover: Every <hi>Age</hi> proves a freſh <hi>Interpreter,</hi> and the ſucceſſive <hi>Revolutions</hi> of this whole world <hi>reveal</hi> to us more and more of its rare and admirable <hi>Concord,</hi> and we come to find things that ſeemingly moſt <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd</hi> in the higheſt and ſafeſt <hi>agreement;</hi> Which, when we conſider by how many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pens, and at how many ſeveral and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant times, this Book was handed down to us, could not be the effect of any <hi>Humane Artifice,</hi> nor is it a thing that any Writers by the ſtrength of their own abilities could poſſibly in their own Times deſign or provide for. Nor can we ſuppoſe it the effect of any other cauſe but an <hi>Infinite Comprehenſion</hi> and <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight:</hi> And that the Writers of this Book were in all times guided in what they wrote by the <hi>Supreme Wiſdome</hi> of that <hi>one God</hi> who is <hi>conſtant</hi> to <hi>himſelf</hi> and the <hi>Same</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>This conſideration of the Pen-men God made uſe of for the Writing of this book, and thoſe Humane circumſtances that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their doing it, goes thus far, That there is at leaſt as much (if not More) Ground to believe this book upon that ſingle account, as there is to Receive any other Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors we are moſt ſatisfied in: Indeed as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional inducements to credit thoſe men that wrote the <hi>Bible,</hi> conſidering Who they were
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63973:130"/>that wrote it, and how, and when, and upon what Termes they wrote it, as to credit any other Authors we leaſt doubt of; And if ſo, theſe two things will follow upon it; Firſt, That he that rejects the <hi>Bible,</hi> obliges himſelf to believe <hi>no other books</hi> without apparent diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity? Secondly, He that does credit the Authors of this book with the ſame credit wherewith he credits other Authors, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they were men of common honeſty that would not knowingly write an untruth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then refuſe to receive it as a book <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> upon as good termes of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as he believes any the beſt humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in its Kind to be True, becauſe they themſelves tell us that it is ſo, (which were it otherwiſe without moſt impudent falſhood they could not do) that God himſelf inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to write it, That 'twas no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their own, but that every part of it is the genuine Dictate of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the ſecond place, in the <hi>manner</hi> of this books conveyance we ſhall find a further and more unqueſtionable ground of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a <hi>Divine witneſs</hi> given by <hi>God himſelf</hi> to the Truth of theſe Writings, to aſſure us beyond all reaſonable doubt, they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by men that did not deceive us, but ſuch
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63973:130"/>as were Intruſted by <hi>himſelf</hi> for that purpoſe; And that is the <hi>miracles</hi> that were wrought, and which viſibly accompanied their firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication.

Thirdly, Whether <hi>Miracles</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in themſelves are always an unqueſtionable proof of that Doctrine they are wrought to confirm, and an infallible juſtification of the integrity of the perſons that work them!

               <hi>Conceſsion:</hi> And 'tis of great remark, That the Warmeſt Adverſaries, the Scriptures have met with, have never denied the Fact of thoſe Miracles pleaded in their behalf, but indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to invalidate their teſtimony ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; Neither the Miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> (which we find often mentioned in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Story</hi>) nor of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are denied by any in point of Fact, but both fathered upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Magick.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the Heathens heretofore, as we find in <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Apuleius.

            <p>Fi ſt, What they ſay does not anſwer that end for which they themſelves intend it.

               <hi>Dr. Jackſon</hi> ſays in his Book upon the <hi>Creed,</hi> both thoſe Cures were well known to the moſt Judicious <hi>Roman writers</hi> of thoſe times, and ſo conſtantly avouched by them, as can leave no place (ſayes he) for ſuſpition in Ages following.</p>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The admiſſion of the contrary is no way deſtinctive to thoſe natural notions we have of Gods Attributes, and his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Rule over the World; becauſe God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver puts men under any rational neceſſity by it to credit a falſhood. He never permits men to be exerciſed with any ſuch Trial, but when there is Evidence ſufficient accompanying it to aſſure us 'tis but a Trial of our ſtability, and ſo intended. 'Tis no way unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that God who is infinitely wiſe, and above us in the ways and Methods of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Rule, ſhould for Holy and excellent Ends we cannot reach, exerciſe the World with the greateſt Trials, even Trials from an appearance of his Almighty power, ſo long as he ſtill affords a plainly Superiour Evidence to Truth, and ſo Circumſtantiates things that there is abundant ground of diſtinction. To make this appear is of chiefeſt concern in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of this matter, how <hi>Gods Miracles</hi> can be an <hi>infallible Evidence,</hi> if the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Ill men</hi> be ſometimes inabled, (for ſo it is to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63973:135"/>be underſtood; for by no inherent power of their own can they do it) to act alſo in a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi> and <hi>miraculous</hi> way! for if a <hi>miracle</hi> by whomſoever wrought be not a ſufficient proof of any Doctrine 'tis wrought in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of, twill then be ſaid the Teſtimony from <hi>miracles</hi> ſeems to to be much <hi>Invalidated,</hi> and Mankind to be left at great uncertainty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
            <p>That God, when he is pleaſed to eſtabliſh Divine truth to the world by the power of <hi>miracles</hi> does make that Teſtimony <hi>unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,</hi> and clearly <hi>Diſtinguiſh</hi> the witneſs given by <hi>His miracles,</hi> from any witneſs the <hi>Devil</hi> or his <hi>Inſtruments</hi> can give by any either <hi>ſeeming</hi> or <hi>real operations</hi> of that kind, will very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear theſe three ways.

                  </gap>ter</hi> about which he proceeds. Firſt, God maks the <hi>miracles</hi> he works from Heaven an infallible Teſtimony by the <hi>order</hi> of his proceeding. He <hi>primarily,</hi> and in the <hi>firſt</hi> place <hi>before</hi> falſe Doctrine and worſhip can have any ſuch pretence, by the power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ſettles and fixes his own truth, and makes that ſo ſetled a Rule to us to try all other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines by. God has been ever <hi>beforehand</hi> with the Devil and his Inſtruments in this
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63973:136"/>kind: Nor have they ever been ſuffered to attempt the World this way, till truth was <hi>Firſt</hi> ſo unqueſtionably ſetled, that there was abundant ground to ſecure unbyaſſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced men from any ſeduction, were the temptation to it never ſo great.

            </p>
            <p>So under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the Goſpel was firſt eminently eſtabliſhed by unco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>olla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>miracles,</hi> as the great <hi>Standard</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of all ſuture <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And acquaints us that there is no further Revelation to be expected, before the wonders and Miracles of Seducers
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63973:137"/>were extant. And when God has, by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power, once unqueſtionably eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own truth, all pretences to Miracles, be they feigned or real they come too <hi>late.</hi> Truth is in poſſeſſion, and by that all things are to be tried, and whatever is found oppoſite to it, is but reaſonably to be reckoned as a <hi>Trial</hi> and a <hi>temptation</hi> only to <hi>prove</hi> us. The <hi>Broad ſeal</hi> of Heaven is already ſolemnly and openly ſet: And let the Devil bring what <hi>ſhews</hi> he can of the ſame impreſſion, they are ſtill to be rejected. And whatever the Devil has been at any time able to do of that kind, has been but this <hi>ſecond</hi> hand work, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men from a truth <hi>beforehand</hi> unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>eſtab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>liſhed,</hi> and to which there was Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient (whatever could be done to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to the contrary) for all men to adhere. And this made St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> much urged upon him in their juſtification, a power they had of working Miracles, to tell them, <hi>The truth was that way fully ſetled before, and we had warning enough not to be ſeduced from the Orthodox Doctrine of the Goſpel by any ſuch pretenſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>manner</hi> of Gods proceeding in his working of Miracles to aſcertain the World, does ſufficiently ſecure us againſt the danger of being ſeduced by <hi>Impoſtors</hi> that way,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63973:137"/>and any Miracles they can produce, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; Firſt, The grand <hi>occaſions</hi> upon which God ſtill works them. Of how vaſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the rearing up of both <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> and juſtifying the <hi>deſcent</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> Secondly, The number of them, How far have Divine Miracles out-gone all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in that kind. Thirdly, The <hi>Eminency of them.</hi> Fourthly, The <hi>Perſpicuity</hi> of them to all ſorts of men. Fifthly, Their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance without the leaſt outward <hi>means,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there might poſſibly lye a deceit. Sixthly, The long and laſting continuance of them. In all theſe reſpects are Divine Miracles diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced from all Diabolical Actings that way, which for the moſt part have been <hi>fictitious</hi> and diſcoverable ſo to be: and when real, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but <hi>few,</hi> and in no ſort bearing any proportion to any of theſe Circumſtances, wherewith Divine Miracles have been openly accompanied. And 'tis alſo to be noted, that very many of thoſe Miracles we are told of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Heathens,</hi> admitting them true, were not wrought to confirm or juſtifie their <hi>Religion,</hi> but upon other occaſions: often for ends concealed and wrapt up in the Counſels of God which we know not of, and ſometimes for other ends then to eſtabliſh their Religion viſible, as it ſeems to be in the caſe of <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:63973:138"/>whom God had deſigned as his Miniſter to execute ſo many dreadful Judgments upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore would eſtabliſh him by thoſe extraordinary Actings in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which with great difficulty, and againſt much probability to the contrary he obtained; and as <hi>Sueton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> ſayes of him after he had obtained it, wanted Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Authority and Majeſty to manage ſuch a Dominion. A clear inſtance concerning this whole matter God gave us at firſt in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> oppoſition to <hi>Moſes;</hi> wherein he gave us to know, that although Divine Truth might by Miracles be oppoſed, yet the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Luſter of his own Miracles ſhould be ſo viſible to all, as perfectly to ſilence and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the reſt, and both in <hi>Number, Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> as then it was, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſhould be to every Eye obvious and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>matter,</hi> for the eſtabliſhment of which Divine Miracles are ever wrought, affords us ground ſufficient to diſtinguiſh in this caſe. 'Tis always a doctrine leading us to that God of whom we have a notion imprinted in our own Nature, revealing him further to us, and inſtructing us in all thoſe Holy Virtues, and excellent ways of living, that moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to our Natural light, are moſt ſuitable
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63973:138"/>to that natural Divinity we are born with, and evidently tends to make us moſt happy here, and conduct us to the higheſt reward hereafter. Whatever miracles we ſhall at any time ſee wrought, to juſtify a Contrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, my own <hi>Reaſon</hi> will reject as a <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and aſſure me that in the one caſe a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle is ſent from God to <hi>Aſcerta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> me, and in the other the Devil is only inabled in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner to <hi>Tempt</hi> and to <hi>Try</hi> me. And theſe three ways in the caſe of miracles, are we ſufficiently ſecured againſt all the attempts that can be at any time made to ſeduce us that way: And may hereby reſt abundantly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the teſtimony of Divine Miracles, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Divine Truth, by whatever ways the Devil ſhall be able to countenance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Contrary Intereſt</p>
            <p>Now, That the Scriptures have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Miracles in their conveyance, is not (as before is proved) by any denied. And that thoſe miracles have the advantage of all the foregoing circumſtances is likewiſe very evident. The Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> is the <hi>Firſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rn</hi> of all others, being the Religion that was from the <hi>Beginning.</hi> God, in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> ſetled and conſecrated That by a <hi>miraculous Power,</hi> before any other Syſteme of Religion was extant, and gave it therein
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63973:139"/>the <hi>Precedency</hi> of all falſe Prophets and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors and whatſoever Doctrines they ſhould by that means oppoſe it withall. And ſo the New Teſtament being the natural product of the old, is by the miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> at the firſt, and thoſe of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after (upon the validity of both which 'tis eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſecured againſt all oppoſition that can that way be made againſt it to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of Gods working thoſe miracles by which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are juſtified to us to be his Words, has eminently diſtinguiſhed them from all other operations of that kind. So 'twas in the times of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the Devil by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> went further that way then ever he did after. How far did the miracles of <hi>Moſes</hi> exceed His! <hi>More</hi> miracles! <hi>Greater</hi> miracles! More <hi>Continued</hi> miracles! <hi>Undeniable</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable</hi> evidences of Gods Infinite and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, in a way far ſuperiour to what they could bring about! Under the Goſpel the miracles have been ſuch in the <hi>manner</hi> of their working, as leaves no room to doubt of Gods intention to ſecure us from Heaven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Nor were there ever any operations either of men or of Angels viſible in this world that with any colour of Juſtice and Truth can (all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered) be put in ballance with thoſe eminently <hi>miraculous actings</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> contained in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which the <hi>miracles</hi> were wrought to confirme, and to aſſure us of the ſincerity of thoſe that delivered them to us, is moſt evidently from God, moſt correſponding to our Natural obligations to him, and is in it ſelf directly oppoſite to the whole Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Debauched and Evil men, deſtructive to all corrupt Doctrines and Practices what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and perfectly ruinous to the Intereſt of the Devil in this World, of which there needs no other proof but an appeal to the Judgments of all ſober minded men. Never was there any Doctrine brought to light, ſo Holy, and ſo excellent. A Doctrine that has viſibly the higheſt tendency to thoſe two great ends of all Religion, the <hi>Honour of God,</hi>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:63973:141"/>and <hi>Mans preſent and future happineſs.</hi> No Inſtance can be given of any particular Duty enjoyned Deſtructive to mans true happineſs, but all perfective of it. The ſtricteſt ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial has a Recompence propoſed to us of a hundred fold in things of a far more Noble and excellent Nature, and moſt ſuitable in all ſuch caſes to a Rational choice. The reſult of the whole is this: Whenever Miracles are wrought to eſtabliſh ſuch a Doctrine as in the judgment of right Reaſon is likely to come from God, we are upon the higheſt and moſt unqueſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onable ground of Aſſurance that we can be. Whenever a Miracle is wrought to eſtabliſh a contrary Doctrine, 'tis the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Trial,</hi> But ſtill God is pleaſed to order it ſo, that we have ground ſufficient to oppoſe and will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Firſt, Weakly grounded; for there is no other ground for it, but that in an <hi>Apocryphal Book</hi> that goes under the Title of <hi>the fourth Book of</hi> Eſdras (a Book every where ſtuffed with Childiſh and fabulous Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) There we find this abſurd fiction, that <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſhould ſpeak unto God, and tell him, <hi>Thy Law is burnt, and no man knoweth the things that thou haſt done,</hi> and therefore deſired to be inſpired to write it all over again, and to wrire all that had been done in the World from the beginning: And that after he had been forty days and nights with God (in an apiſh fooliſh imitation of <hi>Moſes</hi>) and had taken a <hi>Potion</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:63973:146"/>God had prepared for him, he dictated all the <hi>Bible</hi> over again to <hi>five</hi> men. Now, of how little credit this <hi>Relation</hi> (being no where found but in this Book) ought to be with any conſidering man, will appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this Book was not only conſtantly rejected as <hi>Apocryphal</hi> by the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> as a <hi>counterfeit</hi> under <hi>Eſdras</hi> his name, and none of his, but has been ſo by all ſorts of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under the Goſpel. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> calls it <hi>a Book full of Idle dreams.</hi> The Papiſts themſelves, though they have admitted many other Books that we reckon <hi>Apochryphal</hi> into their <hi>Canon,</hi> yet have ſtill rejected this; and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf, in his Book <hi>de Script.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It appears the <hi>Jews</hi> had the <hi>Scriptures</hi> with them during the time of their Captivity in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> both from <hi>Daniels Prophecie,</hi> who Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied there, and alſo from other Hiſtorical Evidence.

               </gap>ears were to be reckoned. Nor was the Prophecie uttered by <hi>Jeremie</hi> to comfort thoſe that were captivated with <hi>Jeconias,</hi> to commence when uttered, nor till the deſtruction of the City, and the laſt Captivity of <hi>Zedekiah:</hi> All which <hi>Daniel conſidered,</hi> and by comparing theſe

Secondly; From Hiſtorical Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſayes, the Reaſon why <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſet on foot the rebuilding of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and reſtoring of the <hi>Jews</hi> to their Countrey, was his reading the Prophecie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which was written <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble that God made uſe of the <hi>ſight</hi> of that <hi>Prophecie</hi> to engage <hi>Cyrus</hi> to what he did; for otherwiſe 'twas a thing in it ſelf moſt abſurdly impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and againſt all ordinary Rules of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to reſtore ſuch a people, and rebuild ſuch a place, that had been ſo famous and ſo terrible to all the Nations round about.

               </gap>s not to be doubted but <hi>Jeremie</hi> preſerved <hi>it</hi> with the <hi>Ark,</hi> and had an eſpecial reference to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63973:149"/>the ſecuring of it, in what he then did. This we affirm as a truth to which both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have aſſented, that at the return of the people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the care of <hi>Eſdras</hi> about the <hi>Bible,</hi> and that great <hi>Synagogue</hi> that was then according to <hi>Moſes</hi> his firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution aſſembled (in which were preſent <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai, Zacharie; Malachy, Nehemias,</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi>) was very eminent and great; and to this day we derive ſingular advantages from it. For firſt, with great diligence they made an exact ſeperation between ſuch Writings as were of Divine Inſpiration, dictated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and were to be a ſtanding <hi>Rule</hi> to the Church in all Ages, and all other Writings whatſoever, whether written by true Prophets or falſe, for even true Prophets and ſuch as were moſt eminent, might, (and without doubt, many of them did) write diverſe things without any immediate aſſiſtance or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God, and conſequently which were nor of <hi>Divine Authority;</hi> they collected all the ſacred parts of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which during the Captivity lay diſperſed in private hands, no publick uſe being made of them: Incorporated the whole into one intire <hi>Volumn</hi> (an admirable work) in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we now have it, which before was not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be; for ſeveral <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſeveral of the

               <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Books,</hi> were written after the coming of the people into <hi>Babylon;</hi> and it does no where appear that thoſe parts written before were conjoyned in one intire <hi>Volumn,</hi> more of them then the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Original Copy</hi> whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf delivered in a publick aſſembly to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> to be layed up in the ſides of the <hi>Ark</hi> (the peculiar <hi>Archive God</hi> had, by his ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand appointed for it; the whole of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> ſo united, they ranked under three Claſſes, and divided into three parts; which diviſion was continued amongſt the <hi>Jews till</hi> the times of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who in the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>St. Luke</hi> refers to it, when he ſayes, <hi>All things ought to be fulfilled which are written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Prophets and the Pſalms.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſucceſs and effect of this Book ſince its conveyance, gives in a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and moſt undeniable Evidence to its Divinity. If we conſider the ways and means by which it has introduced it ſelf, and upon what terms the Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it has gained that reception we find it has had amongſt Man-kind. 'Tis of admirable conſideration that a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on directly oppoſite to the whole corrupt intereſt of humane Nature, and calling men to the higheſt Mortification and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, upon the account of an Inviſible World to come, nakedly propoſed by men, upon a worldly account always inconſiderable, without any the leaſt Earthly ſupports: A Religion perioding the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, and totally ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other Religions: A Religion oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed &amp; diſowned to the utmoſt by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves (though it derived it ſelf wholly from them, and pretended to be the natural product of their Religion, and the true Completion of all they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and expected) a Religion in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtion of which the whole World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides were agreed, and indeed both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> perfectly concurred. I ſay, 'Tis of admirable conſideration that ſuch
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63973:155"/>a Religion ſo circumſtanced againſt all the Religion, the Wiſdom, and the Force of the World, ſhould at firſt make its entrance, and be embraced by ſo great a part of Man-kind, and within the ſpace of thirty years or thereabouts after its firſt Publication, for ſo it was, be ſpread not only throughout all parts of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> but alſo amongſt the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> and remoteſt <hi>Heathens.</hi> To no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſe, but its own Innate worth, and the Divine evidence from Heaven at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, can it with any tolerable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of reaſon be aſcribed. The zeal men had for all other Religions in which they were Educated, ſufficiently prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to hate, abhor, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. The Learning and the Wiſdom of the whole World was employed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it deſpicable, and to bring it under contempt; And all the force of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire</hi> was every where violently at work for its total Suppreſſion and Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. And yet, againſt all theſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invincible oppoſitions, did the <hi>Bible</hi> prevail. The power of that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire could not withſtand the naked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a ſimple Truth; And both <hi>Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> (in the main of it, as a National
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63973:155"/>Eſtabliſmment) and <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> finally fell before it.</p>
            <p>This Book and the Religion it contains, as it avows it ſelf to be ſolely from God, and comes to us with a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice from Heaven, ſpeaks to us in God's own Name, and upon that ſingle account requires our obedience; And thoſe that wrote it, neither had nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have any other Authority but what was Divine and from Above; So it has introduced it ſelf by Means ſuitable thereunto. Never was there at firſt any Force uſed to compel men, nor any Arts practiſed to deceive men about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. No man can prove out of any Story that ever the Apoſtles or the Primitive Profeſſors of this Religion raiſed Arms to introduce or promote it; Or that any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority did countenance or aſſiſt it. The Chriſtian Religion has this to ſay for it ſelf above all others, That 'tis to debtor to the Sword either in a Civil or Military way; Neither the Sword of Juſtice, nor the Sword of War can lay any claim to it, as a Product of theirs. The greateſt part of the <hi>Roman</hi> World <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63973:156"/>it. It ows nothing to any violent courſe for its Primitive Reception, nor indeed to any Humane contrivement; Neither the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> nor the Eloquence of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators aſſiſted in this matter. It never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced one ſtep further in its firſt publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than its own Innate Excellency, &amp; the Divine evidence attending it procured it acceptance: nor did it ever gain a Convert, but where it could approve it ſelf by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Evidences, to the Reaſons &amp; Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, to be Divine? I make a peremptory demand to all <hi>Antiſcriptural men</hi> to grant me this, as a truth not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any denial, That for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together the Goſpel by its own Divine ſtrength, withſtood the moſt furious and violent Winds &amp; Tides of all humane oppoſition, and by no other aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance but what was purely Divine, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled moſt parts of the World over: It offered it ſelf to mens reception upon no other terms but by an Appeal to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Concience, and was contente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To the firſt, their very Enemies the <hi>Heathens</hi> bore teſtimony; <hi>Pliny</hi> and others ſpeak of the Chriſtians harmleſs and holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. For the latter, Never was any Religion ſo begun and propagated by ſuch indefatigable Sufferings: How few Martyrs for Religion can the Heathen World boaſt of! If we admit <hi>Socrates</hi> for one, how few Succeſſors had he? And thoſe few they pretend to, ſeem by all Circumſtances to be ſuch as had no other end but to perpetuate their own names to Poſterity, by ſuffering for ſuch things as they thought the World would highly magnifie. But for Chriſtian-Religion we find innumerable ſufferings of Men and Women of all Ranks, Qualities, Ages, and Conditions: In many of which we cannot ſuppoſe any thing but Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and hopes of a future Reward could poſſibly be the Motive; Being perſons of ſuch mean parts and conditions, as could no way be thought to deſign a Name to themſelves hereafter. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can we reaſonably ſuppoſe an eſteem upon Earth, and vain-glory, could be the ground upon which any of them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, when we conſider they ſuffered for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63973:157"/>a Religion, the very name of which was every where Odious and Deteſtable, and the Profeſſion of it brought nothing but ſhame and contempt. It ſwims down to theſe latter Ages in whole ſtreams of Blood that ran from its Primitive Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; God pleaſing to introduce the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel at firſt without any thing Humane to befriend it, that we might be for ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained of its Author. Who but God himſelf by a Power from above (can we reaſonably imagine) could have enabled a few Mean, Ignorant, and Contemptible men ſo to confront the whole World, and in the Evening of it, (when other Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had ſo long laſted, and were ſo faſt rooted) to erect a Religion deſtructive to all the reſt; and to break through all the Oppoſition that the Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> the Philoſophy and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the knowing parts of the World, the Laws and force of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Empire</hi> in its greateſt ſplendor and ſtrength, could form againſt it?

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63973:157"/>How ridiculous does it appear to ſuppoſe a company of mean Impoſtors that had neither God nor Men beſides themſelves to befriend them, nor any other Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but a Deſign in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to cheat and abuſe the World, could have effected all this; and that they ſhould finally ſo prevail, and impoſe the groſſeſt Deluſion imaginable upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, againſt all ſuch Oppoſition! Had I no other conſideration to induce me to believe the <hi>Bible</hi> but what ariſeth from hence, this one ſeems ſingly ſufficient to me to juſtifie its Divinity, againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſuſpition of Impoſture, and for ever to ſilence all the doubts that can be at any time made about it. What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſſurance can we have that a Doctrine is Divine, and comes from above, then when we ſee it has ventured it ſelf upon its own Divine Evidence, againſt all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Oppoſition, and ſingly by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed and ſpread it ſelf all the World over: Neither Arms nor Councils, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Policy of <hi>Julian,</hi> nor the Sword of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> could put a ſtop to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.

We find all the Religion of the <hi>Heathens</hi> has ſtill grown up under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Humane Power and Authority, and has ſtill decayed when Humane props have been removed. I challenge any man to ſhew me any other Religion that ever prevailed in the World without Humane help! and that ever ſtood out the brunt of Perſecution! All other Religions but what have been founded upon the <hi>Bible</hi> have ſtill fallen before the Power of the Sword; 'Tis only the Religion of the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (founded at firſt upon the <hi>Bible,</hi> and the Miracles wrought to confirm the Doctrine contain'd in it) that has weather'd out all attempts for its eradication. 'Tis a marvelous evidence of that ſolemn and divine foundation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> were at firſt eſtabliſhed, That notwithſtanding all that the <hi>Jews</hi> have ſuffered, and their very Being in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way, and their National Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (in which their Religion chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted) be utterly extinguiſhed, yet ſtill
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:63973:158"/>they retain their Profeſſion, ſubmit to a Yoke of moſt burdenſome Ceremonies, &amp; remain diſperſed in the World, a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scripture-verity,</hi> and ſo many ſtanding Witneſſes to the Truth of many eminent Predictions both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And thus, from the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Book alſo ſince its firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, and all the circumſtances that have attended the progreſs of it, ſince its firſt publication, have we as great an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance as in ſuch a Caſe we can well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that God himſelf, and no other, is in truth the Author of it.</p>
            <p>I come, in the fourth and laſt place, to conſider this Book in it ſelf, in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, as at the preſent we find it, and as it now lies before us. In the doing of which, I mean not to inſiſt ſeparately and abſtractedly upon any Internal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that reſults from the matter of the Scripture it ſelf, but to take it (as it ought to be) in Conjunction with the former, and all other Collateral proof. 'Tis neither Reaſonable nor Warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to disjoyn the proof God has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us of his Word, and lay the weight of its Juſtification upon any one ſingle
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63973:159"/>Evidence; For, when God commands us to believe and obey this Book as his Word, and impoſeth the higheſt penalty upon our not doing it, he layes not the ſtreſs of his Command, or the Penalty (nor ought we) upon any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſort of Evidence, External or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but upon the whole intire proof he has made to us of it, and all thoſe means he has afforded for our Conviction and Satisfaction about it. When we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a general proof of the <hi>Bible,</hi> 'tis not neceſſary to inſiſt upon any Internal Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that reſults from the <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf, as ſingly ſufficient to prove it, or enter into any debate whether it really be ſo or no, becauſe we have all the Cumulative ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an External juſtification. And if all together be ſufficient to prove the <hi>Bible</hi> to be what we that profeſs the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religon take it to be, 'tis enough for our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And that the matter of the <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf, with what ever Evidence will ariſe from thence, is not to be abſtractedly inſiſted on from other Collateral proof, nor that any Collateral proof will prevail in this Caſe without there be alſo an Innate Evidence reſulting from the matter of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63973:159"/>
               <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf, ſo that a Conjunction of the Evidence in both kinds, is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to eſtabliſh a general proof, will be thus made to appear: The <hi>Bible,</hi> as hath been ſaid, conſiſts of three parts, <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Prophetical,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorical;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Evidence we have from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf to prove its own Divinity, muſt needs chiefly ariſe from the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part; Becauſe the Prophetical and Hiſtorical part can never be fully juſtified without Forraign proof; we cannot know the Hiſtory of the <hi>Bible</hi> to be certainly true from the Bible it ſelf: Nor can we ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove any Propheſies in any part of the <hi>Bible</hi> to have been actually f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe they are ſaid in other places of that Book ſo to be: For 'twere to beg the Queſtion, and admit the Book to be true, when we are debating whether it be ſo or no! This we may urge in proof of the Hiſtorical and Prophetical part, from that Divine Evidence that comes from the Doctrinal, that we find ſuch Hiſtory, and ſuch Propheſie in an admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with ſuch a Doctrine, ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to it, tending to the eſtabliſhment of it, and inviron'd with all probable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of being true, both from the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63973:160"/>nature of the Propheſies, and alſo from the excellent Manner of their fulfilling, and from the rare Method of the Hiſtory, in order to the great end of the whole. But at laſt, the Poſitive and abſolute Proof to one that denies it, muſt needs depend upon ſomewhat Collateral to the Book it ſelf. <hi>Secondly,</hi> No External proof of the <hi>Bible</hi> would be ſufficient to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable enquiry, were there not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an Internal Evidence reſulting from it to its Divinity; that is, 'Twere to no purpoſe to urge any Arguments from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Evidences (be they Miracles or what they will) to prove a Book to be Divine, and ſent us from God, did not the Book approve it ſelf to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of right Reaſon likely ſo to be: 'Twere a vain attempt to endeavour to make a reaſonable man, upon any colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral conſiderations, ſubmit to the <hi>Bible</hi> as a Law Divine, did not the <hi>Bible,</hi> upon a due Search into the matter of it, appear worthy of ſuch a Denomination. I much applaud that ſaying of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> upon this occaſion, <hi>For my part</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>I profeſs, if the Doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not appear as good, and as ſit to come from God the Fountain of goodneſs, as
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:63973:160"/>the Miracles by which it was confirmed were great, I ſhould want one main Pillar of my Faith, and for want of it, I fear I ſhould be much ſtagger'd.</hi> Nay, 'tis that Innate and ſatisfactory Teſtimony the Scriptures give at laſt of themſelves, and their own Divinity to our Reaſons, that finally determins all rational aſſent, eſtabliſhes the truth of all other Teſtimonies, and upon which our belief of them as Sacred and Divine, is ultimately founded and eſtabliſhed. So that as, on the one hand, we ought not to inſiſt upon any Internal Evidence, as ſimply ſufficient to Evidence the truth of the Scriptures excluſively, to the External juſtification God has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled them withal, and upon which the full and abſolute proof of divers parts muſt neceſſarily depend; and alſo becauſe 'tis upon all the reaſon God has given us to believe the <hi>Bible,</hi> that be requires our aſſent to it: So, on the other hand, we muſt not deny an Internal evidence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the Innate worth of the <hi>Bible</hi> it ſelf, whereby it appears to our reaſons at laſt to be what other External Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments perſwade us to believe it is. When we taſt the Excellency of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and when we perceive how all the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63973:161"/>matters of Fact ſtand juſtified to us, a Divinity appears in the Whole. We finde this Book to be a rare Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Divine Wiſdom, are convinced upon the whole matter 'tis from above, and bow to the Authority of God (as the formal Reaſon of our Obedience) whom we evidently perceive ſpeaking to us in it.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this Book in it ſelf, in the Matter of it, as it now lies before us; And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I ſhall endeavour theſe two things: Firſt, To ſhew that this Book, ſo far as 'tis capable of being compleatly judged of, by what ariſeth from it ſelf, without any Collateral Supplement, ſo far as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Reaſon becomes a competent Judge of it in its bare propoſal, appears to a reaſonable enquiery, moſt likely to come from God, and to be Divine; And by that internal Evidence ariſing from its own excellent Nature, reflects back alſo a juſtification to all thoſe External Arguments brought to prove it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That in all ſuch things as relate to Matters of Fact, and wherein an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtification is neceſſary to aſcertain us fully about it, we find this Book ſo
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63973:161"/>witneſſed unto, ſo inviron'd with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Humane Teſtimonies, as leaves no room for any reaſonable Doubts to be made about this Matter.</p>
            <p>For the firſt. That this Book, ſo far as we can competently judge of it from it ſelf, appears to be Divine, and that there are many Internal Reaſons of great force, reſulting from the Matter of this Book it ſelf, to perſwade us that it is from God, and written by his ſpecial Command, will be ſufficiently manifeſt in the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe following Particulars. Firſt, We find contained in this Book ſome things that exceed the bounds of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Abilities ever to have found out: Such as could not, in the judgment of right Reaſon, be the product of any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Invention. Not only ſuch things as no man did think of before, (for that every Book contains that gives birth to a New Notion) but ſuch things as no man could ever have thought of: Such as could not have been known amongſt Man-kind any other way than by <hi>Revelation:</hi> And therefore, though written by Men, muſt needs be revealed from Above. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this ſhall be theſe two; Firſt, This Book tells us ſuch things of God,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63973:162"/>of his Nature, of his Eternal Counſels, of the manner of his Exiſtence, as were utterly beyond the confines of all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſcovery, and could not be minted in any Humane Brain. No <hi>fimie Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> could ever have travelled into ſuch Depths and Heights as by this Book we are acquainted with, and appear to us to be in the Counſels of God, in order to the glorifying of himſelf by the Works that he has made. No man could ever have imagined a <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Deity,</hi> or ſuch an exiſtence of one Simple Eſſence as this Book acquaints us withall: Theſe are ſuch things as could never be ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd out in any Humane Shop: Such as without Revelation could never have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into any created Mind to conceive of. Secondly, That contrivement we find in this Book of Saving the World, and rebuilding the fallen Tabernacle of Humane Nature, is evidently a reproach to the beſt abilities of Man-kind, and an undenyable inſtance of this kind; 'Tis not onely what was unthought of before, but what lay infinitely diſtant and wide from what could be thought, either by Angels or Men, and directly fathers it ſelf upon that <hi>Supream Wiſdom</hi> that is
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:63973:162"/>
               <hi>Above.</hi> And that firſt in reſpect of the thing in it ſelf conſidered; And ſecondly, In reſpect of the Manner and Method of its Accompliſhment. Firſt, In reſpect of the Thing it ſelf; and that on two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, The height of <hi>ſtupendiouſneſs</hi> that is in it, and the tranſcendent degree of <hi>excellency</hi> that is in it. Firſt, The <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiouſneſs</hi> of it; What a hidden and amazing Myſtery, how far removed from any mortal view or imagination, was this, That the Second Perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity ſhould deſcend from Heaven, and aſſume Humane Nature into a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Divine! and in that conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction become the Saviour of the World! That He ſhould take upon Himſelf, in His own Perſon, the Sin and Guilt of Man-kind! Die for the World! Make thereby a Satisfaction proportionate to Infinite Juſtice! and prepare a way for God to expreſs himſelf in the utmoſt act of Mercy, in a conjunction with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt exerciſe of Juſtice! No leſs than an Infinite Underſtanding could have ſhaped ſuch a Deſign, or been the Author of ſuch a Projection: Nor could any but God himſelf (with whom all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that are in themſelves poſſible) have
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:63973:163"/>found out an expedient to have reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe two Infinite Attributes in his dealings with an Apoſtate Creature. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Such a ſtrange prodigious Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency appears in the whole buſineſs of our Redemption, ſuch a floodgate of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Supernatural Truth is let open by it, that not only the wiſeſt Men, but the Angels themſelves look with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt admiration upon it. Indeed, all the Ends of God and Men are ſo attained by it, and in a way ſo ſutable to the Nature of Both, that nothing but the Boundleſs Wiſdom of God could have contrived it. In what a ſtupendious and unthought-of way is God, in all his Attributes Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, Exalted, and Glorified? After how excellent a manner is the Evil of the World, both in reſpect of the Guilt and Dominion of it obliterated and expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? To how aſtoniſhing a degree is the whole Intereſt of Man-kind provided for? And to how great a Happineſs here and hereafter is the World recovered? And this in a Way, and by Means far out of the reach of the wiſeſt Thoughts, by the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel. In which there are three things of ſingular remark. Firſt, That a Man is brought thereby to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63973:163"/>as near a converſe with God, in the trueſt exerciſe of his Rational Faculties as our Nature will bear, and as can be had in this World, conſidering that infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance there is between the Nature of God and our preſent compoſure. Secondly, The greateſt preſent, and future <hi>happineſs</hi> is propoſed to Man-kind upon ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified Terms, and with ſuch regard to the Impotency of Humane Nature, as is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to conſider. 'Tis not made ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to depend upon Perfection of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Sincerity of Intention. Thirdly, Proviſion is made for the greateſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Homage that Man-kind can pay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; Man is brought to do the Moſt he can, in a way moſt ſutable to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as a Free and Rational Agent, and yet to the higheſt <hi>Self-reſignation,</hi> and God has the Glory of all his Actings. Never ſuch Sanctity and Conformity to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; Never ſuch willing and choſen Obedience, Never ſuch inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and love to God, nor ſuch ſelf-denyal for God, as the Goſpel produceth: And yet men ſtill depending upon Divine Aſſiſtance for all this. The glory of the Whole redounds to God: His goodneſs alone is magnified; Man is ſo debaſed,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63973:164"/>and God ſo exalted: Man becomes ſo Happy in that Debaſement, and God ſo Glorious; and both in a way ſo ſuitable to the Creator of all things, and a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Indeed, the Righteouſneſs of Man is introduced in ſuch a Subordination to the Righteouſneſs of God, as fills us with the higheſt Admiration, and could never have been the effect of any Human Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>The manner alſo by which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have introduced the full and perfect diſcovery of Chriſt from the beginning, is ſuch, the deſign of it appears ſo to be laid, as evidently points us to God. The whole Scriptures, even the difficulteſt parts of them, ſeem in a wonderful way to iſſue and unravel themſelves into Chriſt as their great and common <hi>End.</hi> If we dissect the <hi>Bible,</hi> and rip up the Entrails of both <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> after how excellent a manner does <hi>Chriſt</hi> appear to be the great <hi>Soul</hi> of the Whole! And how ſtrange and prodigious a <hi>vein</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom do we perceive running throughout all the Parts relating to <hi>Him!</hi> What a curious piece of <hi>Divine Skill</hi> to any conſidering Mind, is the <hi>Scripture-Method</hi> of <hi>revealing</hi> our <hi>Saviour!</hi> In what
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63973:164"/>peculiar, unthought-of, yet ſtrangely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and agreeable Expreſſions, is he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed! In what deeply <hi>Myſterious,</hi> yet fully <hi>ſignificant</hi> Types and Shadows repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented! What a <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>obſcure,</hi> yet <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> Image was drawn of him under the Law! With what un-ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable variety of Predictions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies was he foretold! And with what a ſtrange concurrence of all parts of the Old Teſtament, was Chriſt brought forth in the New! The New Teſtament is ſuch a Counterpart of the Old, and the Old ſuch a Juſtification of the New, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both there appears ſuch a harmony, reſulting from ſuch a ſtrange variety about this Matter, as none but God himſelf could ever have tun'd them into. And indeed, the whole of this buſineſs, both for Matter and Manner, appears an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent effect of <hi>divine Wiſdom</hi> and cannot be aſcribed to any other cauſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We find the Laws contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Book to be of ſuch a nature that they reach the Inſide as well as the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of all Man-kind: Pierce into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of every Man's own Breaſt, govern a Man's moſt retired Thoughts, ſpeak with abſolute Authority to the <hi>Grounds</hi>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:63973:165"/>and <hi>Principles,</hi> the <hi>Deſign</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> of all mens Actions; And this ſeems much to evidence their Divinity. Who but God himſelf can exerciſe a Dominion over the <hi>Mind,</hi> ſpeak to the <hi>Heart,</hi> and judge of the firſt and inviſible riſings of diſobedience there? Two things upon this account are very conſiderable from what we find in this Book. Firſt, That 'tis throughout equally directed to the mind, and to the thoughts of men, as well as their outward Actings: Forbids inward <hi>coveting</hi> and <hi>luſting,</hi> upon the ſame penalty that it does the groſſeſt Practice of evil. This, as 'twas never done in any Heathen Laws, ſo 'twere abſurd for any Humane Authority to attempt it: becauſe things of that nature are onely connizable by an Infinite Knowledge. Secondly, This Book does not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an inviſible dominion in that kind, But it makes ſuch a diſcovery to us of the inſide of the World, ſpeaks ſo exactly to what we find within our ſelves, does ſo effectually command us, has ſuch a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from every man's own Breaſt, that we cannot but reaſonably ſuppoſe that God himſelf was the Author of it. Who but He that perfectly knows what is in
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63973:165"/>Man, could have encompaſſed him round with ſuch a Law? A Law that divides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and the Spirit, and is a diſcerner of the Thoughts of the Heart. Who, but He, could have given ſuch an exact Rule to the manifold Thoughts and Inventions of Men? There's not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Cloſet in any Man's Soul, into which the force of this Law does not, ſome way or other, extend it ſelf. There's not a Mental Caſe can happen that's left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but falls under ſome Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other from this Book. In ſhort, Here's a Book that tells us the Good and Evil of all our Thoughts, becomes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law to our Inward parts, punctually ſpeaks to all that's in our Hearts; Nay, tells us more than we before knew of our ſelves, and yet find to be true. Is not this likely to be the Voice of God? None but he that made us, that ſees within us, and from a Supream Soveraignty over us, judges upon the Whole that belongs to us, can we reaſonably imagine, could have promulg'd ſuch a Law?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The deſign and tendency of this Book, and the influence it hath upon Humane Life, does greatly perſwade us that 'tis from God, and can have no other
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63973:166"/>Author. The evident tendency of it, is to bring us to the beſt way of Living we are capable of in this World, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, of our ſelves, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Doctrines and Precepts of this Holy Book are ſo juſtified to us from the Light of our own Reaſon, and do ſo directly tend to the perfection of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo guide us to what we our ſelves judge to be beſt, that 'twere extream un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to judge it an Effect of the vileſt and worſt ſort of Impoſture! Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Doctrine taught men to live ſo dutifully to God, ſo comfortably to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo uſefully one to another, ſo tuneably in all Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as this of the <hi>Bible</hi> does. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of this Book are moſt tranſparent Beams of Divine Perfection: They are a Rule given according to what is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally exiſting in the Holy Nature of God, ſo far as we are capable of a conformity to it: And that, in the judgement of right Reaſon, is the Higheſt and Nobleſt account of all good Living; For, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do better than in our Meaſure to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to Divine Perfection. No Law can, with greater Reaſon, and leſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarineſs, nor more indiſpenſably oblige
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63973:166"/>us, than that which appears to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Eternal and Unchangeable Nature of God; And ſuch are the Laws of the Goſpel, The great Deſign of which is to aſſimilate men, (ſo far as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties will bear it) to the excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and that rational <hi>Idea</hi> of it we are all born withal. What crooked and imperfect Lines have men drawn in their beſt Documents both Moral and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, compared with this compleat and excellent Rule of Holy Living! What Pure and Spiritual Worſhip is here! How ſuitable to the Holy Nature of God! What undefiled Religion, without the leaſt mixture of Idolatry or Superſtition! What Superlative Piety and Vertue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any one ſpot of Vice! Yea, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Evil in the very Thoughts! What punctual and perpetual Truth and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is here required, upon no other grounds but pleaſing God, doing good to Others, and hopes of a Reward hereafter! There's not the leaſt taint upon any one Duty the Scripture requires from us, by propoſing any baſe, mean, or ſordid Ends. No vain Glory: No eſteem from Men: No cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Advantages are made the ultimate End of our Obedience. The beſt way
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:63973:167"/>of living, and upon the nobleſt account, is here propoſed to us. An exact <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Life</hi> has as much of Heaven as can well deſcend upon Earth; Makes the World as quiet an Habitation as it can be, and Man-kind as happy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as eaſie one to another in all Converſe and Society as they themſelves can wiſh to be. Where is there a Man (not degenerated below his own Reaſon) but approves the Scripture-Precepts as Excellent, and juſtifies Him in his own Breaſt, that conforms moſt to them? No well-diſciplin'd <hi>Heathen</hi> can refuſe ſo to do. What Charity is here required! Still we are bid to hope the beſt, To look upon all Men with a kind eye, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them into the beſt ſenſe they are capable of. What commands, Not to offend weak Ones! What mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſes! What provocations to Love! What ſtrict injunctions to do good to all men upon all occaſions! With what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and meekneſs are we taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves! Indeed, 'tis ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as makes a Man perfect, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed to every good Work; Brings men to the beſt way of Living, the nobleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Principles of Suffering, and the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableſt
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63973:167"/>way of Dying. Now, How can we better-judge of a Law that pretends to come from God, and to be of Divine Miſſion, than by its Nature, the great Tendency of it, and the influence it has upon Humane Life? And when we find ſo holy and excellent a Deſign as appears throughout this whole Book, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of God, and compleating the Happineſs of Men, and in a way ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to the judgement of right Reaſon, and that Divinity we are Born with; What can we otherwiſe judge, but that ſuch a Book muſt needs be from God? Such pure and untainted Streams of Prety and Vertue muſt needs ſlow from the Fountain of all Perfection. 'Tis not poſſible to imagine that the <hi>Devil</hi> or any <hi>Ill</hi> Men ſhould be ever either able or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to compoſe a Book of ſuch a Nature, that ſhould reduce the World to ſuch a poſture as This does: To make men the beſt Subjects to God, the beſt Friends to themſelves, and the moſt uſeful Citizens one to another. Nothing leſs than an Infinite Wiſdom could have contrived ſo great a Happineſs for the World; And nothing leſs than Infinite Goodneſs it ſelf can be reaſonably thought to be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſer
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63973:168"/>of it. 'Tis extreamly abſurd to think that That Doctrine, which, in the judgment of the beſt Reaſon, is the moſt Pure and Excellent, and moſt uſeful to the World, of any we find in it, ſhould be the product of the Devil, or the worſt ſort of Impoſtors, (and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t muſt be, if it be not from God; for there's no middle way). 'Tis to ſuppoſe that ſuch ſhould out-do Divine-Goodneſs in that wherein my Reaſon bids me expect the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it: And in truth, That the World ſhould ſtand more indebted to ſuch Benefactors for the beſt things, than to God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We find in this Book, a full and moſt comprehenſive account of the Revolution of this whole World in all its changeable Viciſſitudes, and of God's vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Providence in the diſpoſal of all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs. Indeed, We find this Book a compleat Map of the Whole Affair of the World, and God's Government of it. There evidently appears an exact Conformity between the courſe of the World, and what we are here told of it. Nothing comes at any time to paſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictive of, but according to, what is here revealed to us; And this we ſhall
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:63973:168"/>ſind, if we conſider the courſe of things, either in a <hi>Natural</hi> way, a <hi>Moral</hi> way, or a <hi>Spiritual</hi> way: Firſt, In a <hi>Natural</hi> way; The natural courſe of the World has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to this time, according to what <hi>Moſes</hi> at firſt, as from the Mouth of God, declared about it: That there ſhould be <hi>Seed-time</hi> and <hi>Harveſt, cold</hi> and <hi>heat, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> and that <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> ſhould not ceaſe, but ſucceed each other. Secondly, In a <hi>Moral</hi> way; The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given us a Summary, yet ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and full account of what-ever we have ſeen acted amongſt Man-kind to this day, and told us in general of all thoſe <hi>Principles, Deſigns,</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> by which the Wheel of this World has been turn'd about by the reſtleſs minds of Men in all Ages; So that we ſee nothing under the Sun of which we are not ſome way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in this Book. Thirdly; In a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually</hi> way; Here we have an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that Divine Intercourſe which has been, or at any time is, between God and Men; The manner of it ſet down, and the general method of God's proceedings in his <hi>convincing, enlightning, ſanctifying, ſatisfying,</hi> and <hi>comforting</hi> the minds of men. No man can well judge
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:63973:169"/>this an effect of any Humane Deſign, nor can reaſonably think that the private ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or experience of any particular men could have reached ſo far. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Occurrences would ſoon have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed any counterfeit pretence to ſuch an univerſal account of the whole Affair of the World: Nor could any but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf be ſecure, not to miſtake in ſuch a matter. The more we contemplate this World in its various motions, the more we conſider the many intricacies and changes of it, the more is the <hi>Bible</hi> ſtill juſtified to us; becauſe we perceive the whole tranſaction of this World to be there ſtrangely Epitomized. We are not only told in the general what ſhall fall out, that bad men ſhall often Proſper, and good men Suffer; that there is one even to the Righteous and the Wicked; that no man ſhall be able to make a certain judgment of Gods Loving or Hating, by the courſe of things here below; but we are ſo far pointed to the Reaſons and Ends of theſe things, as much juſtifies Providence to us, and greatly informs us about thoſe Grounds upon which God proceeds in his Supream Rule here, in order to his future judgment hereafter.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:63973:169"/>Nothing can befall a good man, or an ill man, or happen in any kind, of which we are not told in the Bible, and of the reaſon whereof we have not ſome general and ſatisfying account. 'Tis extreamly unreaſonable to think that any other but God himſelf (eſpecially, not the worſt deceivers) could have made ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Model of his own Government; and 'tis no little juſtification of this Book, that God viſibly governs the World ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is here delivered. And thoſe Laws muſt needs have all the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal probability to be <hi>Divine,</hi> and come from the Supream Ruler above, ſutably to which all things evidently come about here below, and to which the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of this World, in all times and ages, and in all reſpects, appears exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſponding.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We find in this Book a full and ample proviſion for all the ills that have accompanied mans firſt Apoſtacy, and adequate and proper Cures for all the Maladies of humane life. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis very likely to be a <hi>Divine preſerip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſent from above, to heal and relieve the World. Who but God himſelf can be reaſonably ſuppoſed ſafely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63973:170"/>Man-kind from all the entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Lapſed and Apoſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? I appeal to every unprejudiced man whether this Book be not a general Store-houſe, a <hi>Divine Treaſury,</hi> (far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the World beſides can afford) to ſupply all the wants of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Not only more clearly and fully than was ever before, revealing to us the greateſt good, pointing us to that true <hi>Summum bonum</hi> of a rational Being which Mankind in all Ages, with ſo much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and diſagreement with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, had been groping after, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting us to the greateſt happineſs, but applying ſuitable Remedies to every Diſtemper. Where can any man under the ſenſe of ſin, and the diſpleaſure of God, or under any other dejection of mind, poverty or diſgrace in the World, ſickneſs of body, loſs of friends, or any ſort of affliction, comfort himſelf as he may here? What a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> are we here told of for <hi>Sin!</hi> We find all men in all Religions have ſtill harped upon a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> The Sacrifices of living men were moſt Inhumane, deteſted by the beſt of <hi>Heathens;</hi> The ſacrificing of Beaſts, though generally practis'd, the wiſeſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63973:170"/>knew not what to make of, and thought it ſtrange that God ſhould be Atoned by the fat of a Bruit. How infinitely does the Sacrifice we are acquainted withal by the Goſpel, exceed all the World has thought of in that kind! Of how ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and yet of how ſatisfying a nature is it! What Divine Antidotes are there provided in this Book, from ſuitable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, comforting Promiſes, wiſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, heavenly Counſels, to keep up a ſinking Mind! 'Tis like that Wood where <hi>Jonathan</hi> came in his extremity and found Honey every where dropping, and a taſte of it revived his Spirits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his Vigour. And herein lies the ſtrength of this Conſideration, The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the excellent and proper nature of that relief, and thoſe Satisfactions that upon al occaſions are here propoſed to us: They are no ſuch deluding Trifles as men are cheated into by education, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs in only becauſe they are bred up with a good Opinion of this Book: But they are ſuch things as are of intrinſick value, ſuch as are in themſelves, and in their own Nature moſt real &amp; moſt ſuitable to a rational Being in all ſuch caſes, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified to us from the Light of our own
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:63973:171"/>Reaſon, and that innate Notion we have of a <hi>Deity.</hi> The Voice of the Bible is, <hi>If thou do well</hi> (they own Conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judge) <hi>thou ſhalt be accepted; If not, Sin lies at the door.</hi> We find no reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance here of the Heathen Superſtitions, nor of thoſe Vanities wherewith other Religions, through mens ignorance, and the track of Education, have beſotted the World. The terms of our Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, and our happineſs in this World and the next, are ſuch, and ſo propounded to us, as every mans own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt needs acquieſce in; and there is a ſelf-evident ſatisfaction reſults from the performance of them. It prevails much upon me, this general proviſion I find here made to ſuite all mens conditions in all Times and Ages, and the great worth and tranſcendent excellency of it. And 'tis a great account to us of that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful variety we find in this Book, both for matter and expreſſion; What Depths and Shallows in both reſpects! Sometimes the ſublimeſt Notions clothed with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Expreſſions; Sometimes the eaſieſt plaineſt Truths imaginable; Sometimes Divinity deck't with the richeſt Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Oratory, to delight and inſtruct
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:63973:171"/>the nobleſt and largeſt mind: Sometimes brought down to the meaneſt Similitudes, and expreſſed by things of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe amongſt Man-kind, to be graſped by the pooreſt underſtanding: And yet a decency and majeſty in all. No part of Man-kind but find here a plentiful and ſuitable proviſion for every Condition. Not an impotent impoveriſhed mind but is here relieved, nor a condition ſo mean but is cared for. And this tells us much of the vanity of thoſe who are apt to ſit in judgment upon this Holy Book; To find fault with ſome things as too Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and with others as too mean: To think many Stories, Examples, Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Superfluous, and others wholly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. When ſuch men can fathom the deep and large deſign of this Book, are able fully to comprehend the ſizes of all mens Capacities, and the variety of all mens Conditions, and can aſſure me that what one contemns, or not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, may not prove of excellent and proper uſe to another, I then will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, They are every way fit to correct the Bible, and leave them free to fit the World with a better Model.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, This Book appears ſo compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63973:172"/>that all Truths are viſibly concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in it. Here is indeed a perfect Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſvouz of all ſuch Truths as were any where ſcattered, and the World imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly has had, and all ſuch as they were in need to have; All ſuch natural Truths, both of a Moral and Divine Nature, as the Reaſon of the World does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a full diſcovery of all ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Truths as the minds of men naturally purſue, and are inquiſitive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Whatever is written in mans heart, or upon the Works that God has made, is here, after an excellent manner Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, Juſtified, and Improved: And many defects of natural Knowledge ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally ſupplyed, by a moſt ſuitable Revelation. So that if we'l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> judge of this Book, either by what we certainly do know, or by what we need and deſire to know, and expect ſhould be revealed to us, concerning God, our ſelves, and this whole World; We ſhall find great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to derive this Book from Above, and ſubſcribe to it as Divine. For the Firſt; Never any Book contained ſuch a Syſtem of natural Truth ſince the World began, nor ever ſo far interpreted to us what tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſo; And of this, every mans own
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63973:172"/>Reaſon becomes a proper and competent Judge. Secondly, Never any Book has told us ſo much, nor gone ſo far to fix the reſtleſs minds of men about all ſuch <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> things as they are moſt inquiſitive after. 'Tis here we have a certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God's Nature, and the manner of his Exiſtence; how and when he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the World! With what Deſigns, and to what Ends he diſpoſes and governs it! Whence all our diſorder firſt came! How 'tis to be cured! Sin removed! and Man reconciled to God! 'Tis here we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly aſſured of the Reſurrection of our Bodies, the Immortality of our Souls, and the condition of our future being for ever. 'Tis here, we know all we can know, and all we need to know, both of this World and the next. From no other but God himſelf could ſuch a Beam of Light have broke forth, ſo to enlighten the World; Nor will it ſeem any way tolerable to an unprejudiced Judgment to father ſuch a Book upon the higheſt principle of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and derive it from the worſt deſign that ever the World was defiled with.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that this Book (ſo far as it relates to matters of Fact, wherein an Etxernal
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63973:173"/>juſtification is neceſſary) is ſo far witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto, that there can be no room left for any reaſonable doubt to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Firſt, That there was ſuch a man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſuch a People as the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in thoſe times which the Scripture mentions: That <hi>Moſes</hi> was their Leader, and that he led them out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> wrote their Story, and gave Laws to them, we have atteſted to us by the moſt Ancient Records of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> and the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi> By <hi>Sanchomathon</hi> the famous <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi> Antiquary, <hi>Beroſus</hi> a <hi>Caldean, Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus,</hi> and <hi>Manetho</hi> Writers of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>-Chronicles: The latter of whom, <hi>Manetho,</hi> ſpeaks very particularly both of the <hi>Jews</hi> coming into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their departure thence: And amongſt the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Writers, by <hi>Artapanus, Polemo, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polemus, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as is at large proved by <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Appoin:</hi>) And one of theſe, <hi>Artapanus,</hi> is ſo large in his Relation of the Story of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he ſets down much of the buſineſs of his whole life, and many of his Miracles, his conteſting with the <hi>Magicians</hi> before the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his carrying the <hi>Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:63973:173"/>thorow the Red Sea, and the drowning of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> who purſued them; his dwelling with the <hi>Jews</hi> after in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Who were there</hi> (ſays he) <hi>fed with a certain Snow that God rained from Heaven:</hi> And at laſt, deſcribes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the very Perſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſets down his Stature, his Countenance, and his Complexion. Many of the ſame things are Recorded by <hi>Eupolemus, Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> and others. <hi>Numemus</hi> a <hi>Pythogore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>-Philoſopher (whom we find quoted in <hi>Origens</hi>'s fourth Book againſt <hi>Celſus</hi>) tells us he had read the Life of <hi>Moſes</hi> in many good Hiſtories: And relates many particulars of him, as, his being taken out of the <hi>Water,</hi> his being bred up in the <hi>Court,</hi> that he wrought many <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> and that certain <hi>Magicians,</hi> called <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> attempted to do the like. No one Story amongſt the <hi>Heathen</hi> of any Nation has been ſo witneſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Writers Forraign to that Nation, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews</hi> has been, who from their <hi>greateſt enemies</hi> have received a ſufficient Teſtimony, in point of Fact, to the truth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what he wrote. And indeed conſidering how great and eminent a Common-wealth was at firſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63973:174"/>firſt eſtabliſhed by the Writings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and what a notorious and viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>nce and ſucceſſion there was of it, 'Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Morally impoſſible that the buſineſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Writing in thoſe times, in matter of Fact, ſhould be fictitious and falſe. Of ſo much of the Hiſtory writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Moſes</hi> as relates to things tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted before the Flood, we cannot expect to find any exact and punctual account in a Traditional way: Becauſe of the great diſadvantage of Oral Tradition, eſpecially by the confuſion of <hi>Babel.</hi> And yet, 'tis very evident that ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Remainders of the Ancient Story of the firſt World, about the Creation, the long lives of men in thoſe firſt times, and divers other things were preſerved amongſt the ſeveral Nations after the diſperſion at <hi>Babel.</hi> And we find many things relating thereto in <hi>Hermes, Orphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Homer, Heſiond,</hi> and the moſt Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Writers: Of which <hi>Voſſius, Bochar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and many others have given a very ſatisfying account. Concerning the Flood, that there was ſuch a Deluge, nothing has been more univerſally credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; And becauſe the Tradition of it was, That it befel in the prime time of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:63973:174"/>the World, and men were generally ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the right account of times: Therefore they applyed it ſtill to that time they thought moſt ancient. So the <hi>Thebans</hi> to the times of <hi>Ogyges,</hi> and the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> to the time of <hi>Deucalion:</hi> which Floods of <hi>Ogyges</hi> and <hi>Deucalion</hi> were not two other diſtinct Floods, (as ſome have ſuppoſed) but the ſame Flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> applyed to thoſe times, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by thoſe Names which they thought of greateſt Antiquity. One ſayes well, <hi>What Nation has not believed it?</hi> Even amongſt the remoteſt <hi>Indians</hi> we find the Tradition of it has remained: And <hi>what Author has not ſpoken of it?</hi> Amongſt the <hi>Egyptians, Phenicians Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> nothing more common. And well may we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſhould be ſo; For, Thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the rearing of that Structure at <hi>Babel,</hi> had probably a particular reſpect; in what they did, to the Flood that was paſt, reſolving to prevent the danger of another, (which ſprang from their own Infidelity: For God by his Promiſe to <hi>Noah</hi> had ſecured them againſt all fears of that kind) and therefore had ſufficient occaſion whereſoever they came, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and continue the memory of it. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſus,</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:63973:175"/>one of the moſt antient Writers after <hi>Moſes,</hi> (I mean the true antient <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſus,</hi> and not the latter Counterfeit of him) ſets down the Story of it, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame way that <hi>Moſes</hi> does: Begins his Hiſtory, <hi>Ante Aquarum cladem Famoſam quâ univerſus perut orbis;</hi> And ſayes, There was only <hi>eight Perſons ſaved. Cyril</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> ſhews that <hi>Alexander Polybiſtor</hi> and <hi>Abidene,</hi> under the feigned names of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Xyfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrus,</hi> have writ for the moſt part the ſame Story that <hi>Moſes</hi> has done, of the Flood, and of the Ark, and the Place of its Reſting. And in very many other anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Authors have we particular Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of it. And 'tis evident that many Poetical Fictions, and Fabulous Stories, that we find amongſt the Antient <hi>Heathen-Writers</hi> had their derivations from thence. So that, to doubt about the Fact of what <hi>Moſes</hi> has written in this particular, were extreamly unreaſonable; For 'twere to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny what is eminently witneſſed unto by ſeveral Hiſtorians of ſeveral Countreys, and to withſtand the Stream of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition. The Story of Building the <hi>Babylontan Tower</hi> is particularly ſet down by the ſame <hi>Alexander Polyhiſtor</hi> and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:63973:175"/>
               <hi>Abidene,</hi> as we find them quoted at large by <hi>Euſebius;</hi> They tell us, That Men would needs, in deſpite of the Godds, build up a Tower to the Sun in the place where <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> now is; And when they had built it very high, the Godds overthrew it; And that at that time began the diverſity of Languages. And 'tis obvious to the commoneſt underſtanding, That all that Fiction of the Poets about the <hi>Gyants war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt Heaven,</hi> is but a corruption of this Story. The Burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> is mentioned by many of the beſt credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Authors, by <hi>Diodorus Saculus, Strabo, Tacitus, Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Solinus.</hi> And 'twere eaſie to produce the like Teſtimonies to the moſt eminent Paſſages that <hi>Moſes</hi> has ſet down. That the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> conquered the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> diſpoſſeſt the Inhabitants, and ſetled themſelves in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> is a thing ſo notorious from the Effects, that 'tis capable of no denyal: And we have a large account of many particulars of it in <hi>Procopius, Eupolemus,</hi> and other Authors who wrote of <hi>Joſhua, Samuel, Saul, David,</hi> (in whom, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prediction of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that People came into the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi>) and others mentioned in
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63973:176"/>the <hi>Sacred Story.</hi> That there was ſuch a King as <hi>Solomon</hi> that built a Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem, Joſephus</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Appion,</hi> proves from the antient Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> which (ſayes he) they have kept with great diligence: And therein mention is made of <hi>Solomons</hi> League with the King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and of his building the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the exact time of it, <hi>A hundred forty three years and eight months before the building of Carthage.</hi> The ſame account we have in <hi>Eupolemus, Alexander Polyhiſtor, Haecate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Dius</hi> a <hi>Phenician,</hi> and many others, who have written ſo largely about that Temple, that as ſome have obſerved, There was not a Veſſel, nor any Tool, or Inſtrument in it, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they have not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly mentioned: which exactneſs we find not in any Heathen Story in the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any <hi>Temples</hi> of their own. The Captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon, Cyrus</hi> his obtaining the <hi>Perſian Empire,</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is all punctually ſet down by prophane Writers. <hi>Alexander Polyhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> writes an exact Story of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Propheſie, and of the Captivity. And <hi>Diocles</hi> and <hi>Beroſus</hi> both give an account of the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and that

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:63973:182"/>Laſtly, Being at <hi>Rome,</hi> and having now leaſure, all buſineſſes being paſt, I uſed the help of ſome for the Greek Tongue, And ſo I publiſhed a Hiſtory of all that had happened in the aforeſaid War; Which Hiſtory of mine is ſo true, that I fear not to call <hi>Veſpatian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Emperors in thoſe Wars to witneſs for them; I firſt gave a Copy of that Book to them, after to many noble <hi>Romans</hi> preſent in thoſe Wars; I ſold alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to our own Nation to ſuch as underſtood the Greek Language; Amongſt whom were <hi>Julius, Archelaus, Herod</hi> the Honeſt, and the moſt worthy King <hi>Agrippa;</hi> who do all teſtifie that my Hiſtory containeth nothing but truth, who would not have been ſilent if any thing, either out of Ignorance or Flattery, I had changed or omitted in any particular.</q> The City of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> and the Temple being about forty years after our Saviours time, by <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> totally ruined and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: The <hi>Jews</hi> after that, three times indeavoured to rebuild their Temple; The firſt time was under the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> in the year after Chriſt 136. Which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt had no other effect but the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:63973:183"/>of fifty thouſand of them, with many other ſad Deſolations, which we find ſet down at large by that noble Hiſtorian <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Caſſius.</hi> Their ſecond attempt was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which he ſoon quaſhed, but not without great Expreſſions of his Diſpleaſure againſt them, cutting off their Ears, and branding their Bodies, and making moſt of them Slaves and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds. Their laſt attempt to rebuild it, was in the dayes of <hi>Julian,</hi> when they were ſo far from being any way hindered, that they were highly encouraged by <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> himſelf, with Money and all Materials, on purpoſe (as <hi>Sozomon</hi> tells us) to vilify the Chriſtian Religion, and confront our Saviours Prediction. The Story of it we have from one that we are ſure could have no deſign to befriend the Chriſtians: <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus Marcellinus</hi> a Heathen-Hiſtorian, and a Souldier at that time in <hi>Julians</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: He tells us with what immoderate Expences, and indefatigable Induſtry the <hi>Jews</hi> by the help of <hi>Julian</hi> ſet about it, intending to make it more famous than ever: And that to expedite the Work, <hi>Julian</hi> appointed one <hi>Alyppius,</hi> a Perſon of great quality in his Army, to overſee it, and aſſiſt in it: And at laſt, concludes
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:63973:183"/>his whole Relation with theſe words, <hi>Cum itaque rei idem fortiter inſtaret</hi> Alyppius <hi>juvaretque Provinciae Rector, Metuendi globi flammarum prope fundamenta crebis aſſulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus erumpentes, fecere locum exuſtis aliquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties operantibus inacceſſum hocque modo, elemento deſtinatius repellente ceſſavit incaep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Am. Marcel. lib. 23. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>Alyppius</hi> ſet eagerly on the work, being aſſiſted by the Governour of that Province, dreadful Balls of Fire burſting forth, with often aſſaults, near the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, made the place (the Workmen being ſeveral times devoured with the flames) inacceſſible: And after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Element reſiſting, as with ſome kind of deſtiny, the deſign was given over. This was that final ſtroke from Heaven, that put a period to all endeavours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building that place, and to all future at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of reſtoring again the <hi>Jewiſh Church-ſtate</hi> and <hi>Polity.</hi> And how great an Evidence is it to the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the Whole of what our Saviour has ſpoken, to ſind all theſe Predictions againſt his great Oppoſers and Crucifiers ſo ſtrangely and ſo exactly, and in ſo viſible and notorious a manner fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <pb n="348" facs="tcp:63973:184"/>
            <p>And in truth, that general prophetick Spirit we find throughout the <hi>Bible,</hi> thoſe manifold, plain, and direct Predictions 'tis every where fill'd with, of things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and to come, tells us much of its Divinity, and greatly aſſures us, It could not be an effect of Impoſture. Nor is it any way reaſonable to think, That ſuch who deſigned to Perſonate the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in writing a Book, ſhould chuſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it in ſuch a prophetick way, and ſo poſitively and plainly deliver themſelves about ſo many future events: Indeed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout moſt of the great things that have come to paſs amongſt Man-kind; For, the firſt miſcarriage in that kind, a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtake in any one particular, muſt needs ruine the credit of the Whole. No man can believe that God can <hi>lie,</hi> or that an Infinite Knowledge can ever give a wrong Divination about what is to come. He therefore that perſonates the Holy Ghoſt in ſuch a foreknowledge of things, muſt be ſure never to miſs, or elſe reſolve to take the ſhame of his own Impoſture. That in the Heathen-World there have been great pretentions to a fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, is not to be doubted: But upon very different terms to what
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63973:184"/>we find of that kind in the <hi>Bible.</hi> Firſt, Many things pretended to therein in a prophetical way, were ſuch as might hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely be fore-ſeen, and were only the regular Conſequents of ſome natural, and then extant, though more remote and leſs viſible Cauſes. The firſt Diſcoverers of many ſecret workings in Nature, might upon that account have ſoon arrived to a great prophetical Credit. <hi>Thales</hi> who firſt amongſt the Heathens foreſaw an Eclipſe of the Sun, might eaſily have paſſed for an eminent Prophet before the knowledge of its natural cauſe grew common. 2dly, The Heathen Predictions were generally clothed with Expreſſions ſo enigmatical and ſo unintelligible, as in truth render'd them Problems rather than Propheſies. They ſeemed to be framed more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and amuſe, than to inform or ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and to be chiefly calculated to abuſe the weaker part of the World, who are apt to adore what they leaſt underſtand, and to ſuppoſe ſome extraordinary Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be wrapt up in all ſuch clouded Expreſſions: According to that of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius,</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, Their oraculous Divinations of future things, were for the moſt part ſo delivered, that they had divers Aſpects, carryed in them divers intricate Senſes, manifold Ambiguities: And to ſecure their Credit, were made capable of divers (and thoſe contrary) Interpretations: Which made the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves call their great Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi>

               </gap>, a <hi>Thwarter,</hi> or <hi>Crooked-ſpeaker.</hi> Fourthly, Many of their plaineſt and moſt intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Predictions have been conſequently found to be falſe and miſtaken; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them have had a direct tendency to a perfect ſubverſion of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to eſtabliſh the truth of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> ſo 'twas when the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> (which we find repeated by <hi>Porphiry</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that, <hi>All other Godds were but Airy Spirits, and that the God of the Hebrews was alone to be worſhipped;</hi> Which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, had it been followed, had put a final end to all their own Religion. So
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63973:185"/>'twas when the <hi>Sybills</hi> propheſied ſo fully of the coming of Chriſt, which we find repeated out of their Works, in the 4th <hi>Eglogue</hi> of <hi>Virgil.</hi> We deny not but that, for ſome ſecret and to us unknown ends, God (who, as the <hi>Heathens</hi> generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, could onely do it, for they ſtill aſcribed it, even <hi>Porphiry</hi> himſelf, unto their Godds) might and did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reveal ſome future events, which no other way could be known (as he did the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Son, at <hi>Endor</hi>) to the Devil or to others, which they might communicate. But nothing that ever was extant in that kind, can be any way put in ballance with that Prophetick Spirit we find in the <hi>Bible.</hi> 'Tis much in this caſe, as 'twas in the buſineſs of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; The Heathen-world were filled with Pretenſions both wayes: Some of them real and true, but moſt generally fictitious and falſe: And when true, both the Miracles and the Propheſies, from whence we derive a proof of the <hi>Bible,</hi> have been ſo differently circumſtanced, and there is ſuch a ſuperior eminency and luſtre in the one, as renders the other no Objection at all in this caſe. Here we have clear, plain, and poſitive predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:63973:186"/>of moſt of the greateſt things that have happened: Predictions of ſuch things as could have no dependance upon any natural cauſe, then extant when they were made: Such as muſt needs have their riſe from the unbounded Will of God, or the free choice of men. A multitude of ſuch Predictions, with marvalous variety, and great exactneſs and particularity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Perſons and Things, in all Ages, and throughout a conſtant and un-erring Succeſs, without a Failure in a Tittle: And the accompliſhment and truth of the moſt of them recorded in the general Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the World. Who but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, can we ſuppoſe, could pronounce with ſuch a poſitive certainty upon all future events? Not to foretell once, or a ſecond time, what ſhall be here or there, but to ſpeak with a poſitive prophetick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination about all the Great Things that were to happen, and write of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of the World, as men write Hiſtories of Ages paſt; And to have things alwayes rightly come to paſs! Never to miſtake! Conſtantly to give right Divination! This is ſingly the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of God; Nor can any other be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably though the Author of ſuch a
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:63973:186"/>Prophetical Book, but He that graſps all Ages with an Infinite Knowledge, ſpans all Times and Seaſons, from whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be concealed, and who with the ſaine Infinite Eye, equally beholds all things <hi>paſt, preſent,</hi> and <hi>to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude this Matter; If the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of ſome Revelation in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral be reaſonable: If it be not fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God ſhould wholly leave the World to the conduct of Nature, which hath been largely made to appear; If then we find a Book that is, of all others, the moſt Ancient, contains the moſt Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive notions of things, and from which the earlyeſt Authors, (as from the great Fountain and Spring-head of all Divine Learning and Knowledge) appear to have drawn out much of what they have writ: That gives us the moſt punctual account of the Worlds Original: With an exact Hiſtorical Narrative of all the great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Revolutions of it, long before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Writers were extant, with ſuch an adjuſtment of Times all along, that without it no certain Knowledge can be attain'd in <hi>Chronology,</hi> and the ſtudy of it
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63973:187"/>would become more intricate than a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth: If we find a Book written by ſeveral Men, of ſeveral Qualities, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and Intereſts, in ſeveral diſtant Ages, with wonderful variety both for Matter and Manner, promoting (by an unparallel'd agreement with it ſelf) one and the ſame Deſign, and that the moſt excellent in the judgment of every mans own Reaſon, that can deſcend from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or be embraced by men, termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all in the Glory of God, and Man's utmoſt Happineſs: A Book leading us to the fartheſt confines of all natural Truths our own Reaſons comprehend and approve, and revealing ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Truths to us, as appear evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſitted and ſuited to ſupply all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of our natural Knowledge; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an admirable manner harmonize with the rational Nature, in which things from Above are ſo interwoven with things below, and every way ſo proportioned to them, as that Truths Supernatural, which we cannot fully comprehend, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear juſtified to us by Truths natural, that we are perfectly judges of, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both there appears a wonderful
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:63973:187"/>concord: If we find a Book written in God's own Name, commanding the World upon that ſingle account to bow before it, and in a way peculiarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his own Soveraignty and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with a poſitive claim to his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Authority; and the truth of this claim eſtabliſhed to the World by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the greateſt and moſt eminent Miracles, at ſeveral times, openly wrought, that ever were extant, and the Fact of which was never by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd: A Book, the Doctrine whereof, by the power and reputation of thoſe Miracles, its own innate Worth, and the Divine Aſſiſtance that accompanyed it, without the leaſt humane help; nay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Humane-Oppoſition, all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Policy and Force withſtanding it, has gain'd ſo great an acceptance, as we ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Twere moſt abſurd to ſuppoſe that any Book falſely pretending to Gods Name and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deſigning his diſhonour and mans deſtruction, ſhould be capable of ſuch a proof as has been brought in defence of the Bible. And yet, ſo muſt the Tables be turn'd, the whole proof muſt ſo be inverted, of all that hath been ſaid, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary application muſt of neceſſity be made, if this Book comes not from God,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63973:191"/>and be not in truth what it ſelf openly claims to be.</p>
            <p>The Divine Authority of this Book we call the <hi>Bible,</hi> being thus, upon the forementioned grounds, eſtabliſhed: I come, in the laſt place to a Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> as are uſually made about it. All the Material Difficulties that can be propoſed, will be reduceable to theſe four Queſtions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Firſt, How could men come to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in thoſe times wherein the ſeveral parts of the Bible were firſt writen, that they were written by an Infallible Spirit, and upon ſure grounds, diſtinguiſh them from all other Writings?</item>
               <item>II. Secondly, How come we certainly to know the true Compaſs and Extent of <hi>Holy Writ?</hi> How can we know that we have now contained in our Bibles all that was writen by a Divine Inſpiration, and intended as a ſtanding Rule to the Church, and no more? That is, How
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:63973:191"/>can we be now ſafely aſſured about the Canon of the Scripture? And be able, upon good grounds, to ſay, What is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical,</hi> and what is <hi>Not?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. Thirdly, How can we that have not the <hi>Originals</hi> of the Scripture, not the <hi>Autographa's</hi> of thoſe that wrote it, but onely the Copies of them, and moſt but the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> of thoſe Copies, reſt aſſured we have God's Mind as it was firſt delivered?</item>
               <item>IV. Fourthly, How can we believe this Book (ſay ſome) to be from God, when we find contained in it divers Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, ſeveral ſtrange and incredible Stories, and other things greatly lyable to exception?</item>
            </list>
            <p>In anſwering the firſt Queſtion, This ought to be previouſly conſidered; That there were Advantages peculiar to the belief of thoſe who firſt received the Bible, or any parts of it, and lived in thoſe Times wherein it was firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that we have not.</p>
            <pb n="364" facs="tcp:63973:192"/>
            <p>And we have likewiſe ſome Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (and thoſe very conſiderable) to our belief, which they had not. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Pen-Men themſelves, (the Names of many of whom are to us whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown: the Holy Ghoſt not judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it neceſſary to record them: fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the Scriptures would deſcend to us upon other ſufficient Evidence); They were able to judge of their perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and the account they gave of their <hi>Divine Commiſſion;</hi> were Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Miracles, ſaw the Original Writings; And in the Apoſtles times, many knew ſome of their Hands. Theſe we have not; but we ſee the progreſs and ſucceſs of this Book, which they ſaw not; We ſee this Book tranſlated into all Languages: whole Nations converted by it: The Goſpel ſpread all the World o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the fulfilling of many Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſince, which they could not then be Witneſſes of: With many other great Effects of it; We ſee the Whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, and the excellent Harmony of it, and the relation each part has to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the Deſign of the Whole: Are in divers reſpects upon different terms of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:63973:192"/>judging now upon the Whole, from what men were in judging at firſt upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts.</p>
            <p>But to come to a direct Anſwer to this Queſtion: There could be but two wayes to aſcertain men in their reception of any part of the <hi>Bible,</hi> when it firſt became publick.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By ſome outward viſible Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Perſons imployed in that Service, to aſſure us that they were ſent and commiſſionated from God.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, From the Matter and the Nature of ſuch Writings themſelves. And herein a due conſideration of thoſe Times and Seaſons in which the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Bible</hi> were written, and the then preſent ſtate of things, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of writing it, will much inform us. <hi>Moſes,</hi> who layed the firſt and great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the whole Fabrick in the five Books that he wrote, He had a juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Perſonal beyond all queſtion; His Commiſſion and Authority to do what he did, was ſufficiently evident to all that converſed with him; There was all that could be expected to aſſure thoſe that then lived, that God had imployed him;
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:63973:193"/>For God admitted him openly to a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal converſe with himſelf. We read in the nineteenth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Loe, I come to thee in a thick Cloud, that the People may bear when I ſpeak with thee, and believe thee for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, &amp;c.</hi> He impowered him, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſions, to work the greateſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that, ſince the World had a being, had ever been wrought: and openly to ſhame and out-doe all his Oppoſers, and all Pretenders that way. And whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there was a doubt made about this Divine Authority, or any conteſt with him upon that account, as in the caſe of <hi>Korah,</hi> and at other times, God plainly and openly from Heaven, in the ſight of all the People, decided the Matter; to aſſure them, and all Generations to come, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was no Impoſtor, but acted by a Divine Commiſſion in what he then did.</p>
            <p>And indeed, It being the firſt time that God revealed himſelf to the World in a written way, and publiſhed thoſe Laws which were to be a Standard to all that ſucceeded, and the great <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> of all that Revelation, that he would at any time after make to Man-kind; 'twas
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:63973:193"/>but neceſſary it ſhould be fixed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon certain and unqueſtionable grounds. So that ſuch who lived in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, could have no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all to doubt, in the leaſt, of his ſincerity; for all was done that could be done to put that matter out of queſtion. And God viſibly ſhewed himſelf, as we find in the four and twentieth of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and his own glory amongſt them. For, 'tis ſaid, <hi>They ſaw the Lord God of Iſrael, and there was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of a Saphire-ſtone, and as it were the Body of Heaven in its clearneſs.</hi> Nor could there be any doubt raiſed, Whether the Laws and Precepts of <hi>Moſes</hi> were rightly recorded, and as he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould: For, before his Death, he himſelf, by God's ſpecial command, in a publick Aſſembly, delivered over his Five Books to the <hi>Levites</hi> to be layed up in the ſides of the Ark. After <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, till our Saviours coming, and the writing of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> (when there was again a Flood-gate of Divine Power let open in Mighty and Miraculous Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) all the parts of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> that were at any time written (and they
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63973:194"/>were not all Written till the time of <hi>Ezra;</hi> after whom, and the erection of the ſecond Temple, God made no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Addition) all the other parts, I ſay, of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> were principally to be judged of by what <hi>Moſes</hi> at firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; Working of Miracles, after his time, was not to be the great and onely Rule of Propheſie and Revelation. God had declared and commanded the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Nor indeed has the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> thought fit to record to us (whatever might be done in that kind) that any one Pen-Man of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> wrought any Miracles after <hi>Moſes</hi> his time. 'Tis a truth, that there was among the <hi>Jews</hi> a Succeſſion of the Office of Prophets after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and certain Schools of them, which firſt began, and were continued in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Levites,</hi> who dwelt diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the other Tribes: And of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were probably trayn'd up in thoſe Schools we read in Scripture, as of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> and other Seers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: That ſome of them wrote no part of the Bible, nor (that we read of) were any way extraordinarily imploy'd, but moſt likely were ſo ſtiled, becauſe they
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63973:194"/>had their education there, &amp; were bred up and devoted to that Office and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That God did often make uſe of thoſe that were of that Prophetical Socie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty in extraordinary Matters, I doubt not; But in dictating the <hi>Bible,</hi> God was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arbitrarily to chuſe out what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of conveyance he pleaſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd not himſelf to any one ſort of Men, nor to any Prophetical Office, to give us any aſſurance from thence in this caſe; For he ſometimes choſe men out of the Court, as he did <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Kings Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; And ſometimes from the Herd, as he did <hi>Amoz</hi> the Shepherd, who ſayes himſelf, <hi>He was neither a Prophet, nor the Son of a Prophet.</hi> And God, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, by the Word and the Propheſie that he gave ſuch to utter, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them Prophets. And the greateſt evidence of ſuch mens Prophetical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority aroſe (if no Miracles were wrought by them) from the Word they uttered: And if any were (of which we cannot be certain, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> being ſilent about it) from a conjunction of both. A Miracle wrought in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Doctrine correſpending to what God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had at firſt eſtabliſhed,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:63973:195"/>was the greateſt aſſurance that the <hi>Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church</hi> after <hi>Moſes</hi> was capable of; No falſe Prophet in thoſe dayes ever arrived ſo far: That is, They never had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of a Perſonal and a Doctrinal Juſtification together; If any ſuch wrought a Miracle to gain them a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal credit, yet their Doctrine was ſtill faulty: And being to lead men from God, and to ſubvert thoſe Laws of his by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo ſolemnly ſetled, That was an intimation ſufficient from God's own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to diſcover and ſhame them. But, ſuppoſing the ſeveral Pen-Men of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> after <hi>Moſes,</hi> wrought no Miracles at all, and that God made moſt of them Prophets by that very Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which 'tis certain he did, and that they were not previouſly in any ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſo that nothing of that kind could give men any aſſurance; Yet by theſe three wayes, men might be then much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in that caſe, in the firſt Edition of every diſtinct part of the Old Teſtament. Firſt, From the known perſonal Sanctity and Integrity of the Writers themſelves; God never made uſe of any ill men, or ſuch as could come under any reaſonable ſuſpition of Impoſture, to write any part
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63973:195"/>of the <hi>Bible;</hi> nor of any but ſuch whom men in that Age wherein they lived had very good reaſon to credit. This being a certain and revealed Truth, that in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the parts of the <hi>Bible,</hi> 'twas <hi>Holy Men ſtill that Spoke and Wrote.</hi> Now, there could not be a more ſuperlative im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture and wickedneſs, than to aſcend the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, to ſpeak in his Name, and pretend his Authority, without his Order. No Man (not wholly forſaken of all fear of God, and reſpect to men) could be ſuppoſed to make ſuch an attempt: Nor could any Man of known Piety and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty be reaſonably ſuſpected of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, and chiefly, From the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of what was then writen to the Laws and Precepts of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſetled upon ſuch unqueſtionable evidence; for whatever was ſuperſtructed upon that Foundation, came under the ſame Juſtification; So that if any Writings were publiſhed in God's Name, that appeared to be (as all the other parts of the Old Teſtament did) but a further diſcovery and promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> a renewal of thoſe Threatnings and Promiſes in <hi>Moſes</hi> to that People, and a further promotion of thoſe Holy Laws, and that Religion and Worſhip by
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:63973:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>him eſtabliſhed, there was no abſolute neceſſity of Miracles in ſuch caſes. If any man will ſuppoſe there might be in thoſe times Books piouſly written, and grounded upon the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that came not from any <hi>Divine Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> in judging of which Men might be poſſibly deceived and miſtaken. I anſwer, Either ſuch Books pretended to a Divine Miſſion from God, or they did not; If they did not, no man could be indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; If they did, They muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be written by true Prophets or Falſe; No true Prophets would do it; And 'tis not reaſonable to think any falſe prophets ſhould; becauſe they could ſerve no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by it: Nor could the Devil, or any ill Inſtruments any way promote their own Intereſts by perſwading men to ſerve the true God in the right way; Nor do we find that in Fact any ſuch thing ever was. Thirdly, There appeared in moſt, if not all, the parts of a <hi>Bible,</hi> a peculiar <hi>Majeſty,</hi> a ſavour of <hi>Divine Authority</hi> in a more than ordinary way; A great and eminent difference, as the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſayes, between the Chaff and the Wheat. Nor is it fit to ſuppoſe but that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> came by an immediate Inſpiration
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63973:196"/>from God, ſhould carry ſome Impreſſions of his Wiſdom &amp; Power, and be ſome way differenced from the common Writings of weak and fallible men. Beſides, from many other Circumſtances attending the firſt Edition of the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Bible,</hi> relating to the Matter written, and the Authors that wrote, might God give a further evidence to their Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of which we are now wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; And it would be perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of curioſity, and of little uſe to enquire after; And ſome of them are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to us in the Scripture it ſelf; As, particularly, the foretelling of future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, that accordingly came to paſs.</p>
            <p>Two wayes God himſelf had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of all falſe pretentions to Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If any Pretenders that way came to ſeduce men from the true God, and that Divine Worſhip of his then eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, God commands, They ſhould be rejected.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, If they foretold things that came not to paſs, they were no way to credit them.</p>
            <p>So we find it in the eighteenth of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63973:197"/>When a Prophet ſpeaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken, but the Prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly: thou ſhalt not be afraid of him.</hi> The certain predicting of future events, was an unqueſtionable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Divine Commiſſion: And this way many of the Prophets were juſtifyed in thoſe Ages wherein they lived. As particularly the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> who with the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> was ſent to the Ten Tribes at the ſame time that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> were to <hi>Judah:</hi> And in the ſixth year of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (to which time it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Hoſea</hi> himſelf ſurvived) his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie long before againſt the Ten Tribes was actually fulfilled, and the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he propheſied of, came actually and viſibly upon the Ten Tribes at that time, by the Hand of the King of <hi>Aſſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>a.</hi> And others of them had the like Juſtification, though ſometimes it fell out to be later, and the events of their Propheſies could not be known till after-ages. Nor did any one Pen-Man of the Scriptures, or any Prophet of God, ever miſtake in a tittle in this kind; For although ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the judgements they prophetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63973:197"/>threatned, were not actually inflicted at thoſe times, they were threatned ſo to be; yet that could not be the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation from the truth of their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, becauſe God ſtill reſerved a ſupream and ſovereign power of Pardon and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs to himſelf in ſuch caſes: And all ſuch prophetical Threatnings were ſtill denounced with a reſerve in caſe of repentance; And God himſelf, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his own Prophets, did publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare thus much, <hi>At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, or concerning a Kingdom, to pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck up, and to pull down, and deſtroy it; If that Nation, againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from the evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the total and final deciſion of all Queſtions that could ariſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> touching the ſeveral parts of the Old Teſtament, God was pleaſed to make in the times of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and that famous Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, That after ſo long and ſad a captivity, aſſembled to reform what was amiſs, and to revive the glory of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed Church and State, (which God had promiſed to reſtore and continue amongſt thoſe two Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:63973:198"/>until the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come) ſeveral of the laſt Prophets being perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, They, by a divine direction, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all the Parts of the Old Teſtament together, (ſome of which, as the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies ſent from God, and which came by <hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> were wholly rejected by the corrupt ruling part of the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> in thoſe times wherein they were firſt uttered) made a perfect ſeparation, not only between the Works of True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Falſe, and ſuch Writings as came by Divine Inſpiration, and ſuch as were only of Humane Extraction; but between ſuch as were to be of a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al continuance, and a ſtanding Rule to the Church, and ſuch as related onely to particular Caſes, and were not ſo. They, by God's direction, punctually ſetled the Canon of the Old Teſtament, put a perfect period to all Doubts in thoſe times about this whole buſineſs; and in that ſettlement of the Scripture then made, the Jewiſh Church fully acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and to it firmly adhered till the times of Chriſt and the Apoſtles. From whoſe Divine Authority we have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> re-eſtabliſhment of all that was then done.</p>
            <pb n="377" facs="tcp:63973:198"/>
            <p>For the New Teſtament, as God was pleaſed to eſtabliſh the firſt Foundation of all Written Revelation in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, upon evidence from Heaven beyond all compaſs of Queſtion; ſo the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and finiſhing what God intended that way, the laying the Top-ſtone of that Fabrick, (which was done in the writing of the New Teſtament) was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with ſuch manifeſt Effects of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Almighty Power, that no man that lived in thoſe times could make any reaſonable doubt about it. There were in this caſe the greateſt Miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the moſt excellent Doctrine, and 'tis not poſſible to be upon ſurer grounds in point of Revelation. The Miracles were then apparent and viſible; And the excellency of the Doctrine appeared theſe two wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That in it ſelf ſimply conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it introduced a Religion wherein all the great and deſireable ends both of God and Man (in the judgment of all unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Reaſon) were to the utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and wherein all that the World had in that kind at any time before arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at, was far out-done and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <pb n="378" facs="tcp:63973:199"/>
            <p>And ſecondly, In a relative way, in that it evidently appeared (and that in a very ſingular and extraordinary manner) to be the great accompliſhment of all that God had before promiſed and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told: The natural Off-ſpring of the Old Teſtament, and that which the Scriptures, before written, throughout, travelled withal; Indeed, the Genuine Iſſue of all former Revelation, and ſo was incireled with all that <hi>Divine Juſtification</hi> that any former Revelation had been at any time accompanied with. And in the diſtinct publication of all the particular Parts of the New Teſtament, men had theſe two grounds of ſatisfaction in thoſe times: Firſt, (If we admit that Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to come either from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or ſome other Apoſtolical Hand, of the latter of which the Epiſtle it ſelf ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aſſures us; And for the former, there ſeems to be good evidence from ſome paſſages in St. <hi>Peter:</hi> And no man can be ſo reaſonably ſuppoſed to write a Determination of that grand Queſtion then on foot, about the abolition of the whole Judaical Policy, as the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the Gentiles) I ſay, If we admit this Epiſtle to come from an Apoſtolical
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:63973:199"/>Hand; Every Part of it was then writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, men not onely perfectly knowing in all the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of our Saviour, but every one of them then known to be men of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Endowments, in Office under Him, and with the higheſt Delegation of his own Power entruſted by Him. And as the Writing of the Old Teſtament ended with the Prophets, ſo the writing of the New had its period in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Secondly, All the ſeveral Parts, at ſeveral times, and by ſeveral hands written, appear ſo to promote one and the ſame Deſign, are ſo much the ſame in Doctrine, do ſo harmonize in the ſame Tendency and End, and have ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation each to other, that whatever Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there were in the general to ſatisfie men in thoſe times about the Truth of our Saviour, and the Religion by him eſtabliſhed, (and there was all that could be expected from Heaven in that caſe) the ſame would go very far to reſolve all ſuch Doubts as could be made about any particular Parts of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then written.</p>
            <pb n="380" facs="tcp:63973:200"/>
            <p>Secondly, How can we now come cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to know the true Compaſs and Extent of <hi>Holy Writ?</hi> How can we know we have now contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our <hi>Bables</hi> all that was written by a Divine Inſpiration, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Rule to the Church, and no more? That is, How can we now be ſafely aſſured about the Canon of the Scripture, and be able upon good grounds to ſay, what is Canonical, and what is not?</p>
            <p>'Tis too apparent a Truth, that nothing by the power of its own worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, has ever been able to ſcape con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproach from the unruly wills and debauched minds of corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable men. The <hi>Bible</hi> has met with its ſhare in this kind. Some, upon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Pretences, have deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Whole; Others have mangled and ſevered it as themſelves thought good; receiving ſome part only as Divine, and rejecting the reſt as they pleaſed. Of this <hi>Iraeneus, Tertullian, Epiphanius,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and many of the Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have given us a large account. The
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63973:200"/>
               <hi>Manichees</hi> rejected the whole body of the Old Teſtament, as coming from an Evil God. The <hi>Ptolemaites</hi> (as <hi>Epiphamus</hi> tells us) rejected all the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> with ſome other Hereticks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms. Cerdon,</hi> and after him <hi>Marcion,</hi> rejected all the Goſpels but that of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and divers other parts of the New Teſtament, as we find by <hi>Tertullian.</hi> The <hi>Valentimans</hi> rejected all the Goſpels but that of St. <hi>John,</hi> as we ſee in <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> Others rejected all that St. <hi>John</hi> wrote. The <hi>Ebionites</hi> received no Goſpel but that of St. <hi>Matthen,</hi> and rejected in groſs all the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, There is not one Part of the <hi>Bible,</hi> from the firſt to the laſt, that has ſcap'd the reprobation of ſome bad Men. But all ſuch attempts were ſoon blown away, expired in the Birth, bore about them their own ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; made no conſiderable battery upon the Truth in any Age; Nor did they reach further than the vitiated Minds and corrupt Breaſts of ſuch Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Hereticks as were the firſt Authors of them.</p>
            <pb n="382" facs="tcp:63973:201"/>
            <p>In anſwering to this Queſtion, How we come to be well aſſured about the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and that thoſe Books now received by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other Proteſtant Churches as ſuch, are all Canonical, and no other.</p>
            <p>Two things only will occur, that are of any ſeeming moment; In the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of which, all will be ſaid that is needful about this Matter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How we come to reject out of our Canon thoſe Books commonly called <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> which were written (at leaſt all but one of them) during the times of the Old Teſtament?</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, Upon what grounds we now receive ſome particular parts of the New Teſtament, which have ſometimes layen under queſtion?</p>
            <p>If we miſtake in the firſt, we have leſs in our Bibles than we ought: If in the latter, we have much more than we ſhould. About the firſt, concerning the ſeveral parts of the Old Teſtament, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians themſelves a preſent Diſagreement: But concerning the other, the whole Chriſtian World is, at this day, of the ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, That there is good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:63973:201"/>to reject thoſe Books commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> that they were not written by any Divine Inſpiration, nor ſent us from GOD, as any part of thoſe Supream Laws by which he intended to rule and judge the World, and ſo ought not to be reckoned within the Canon, will be made very evident to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Judge, upon theſe Conſiderations following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, After the time of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and the erection of the ſecond Temple, 'tis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally agreed by all the moſt Antient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> had no Prophet amongſt them, Nor did GOD raiſe up any Man with an Extraordinary Spirit from the time of <hi>Malachi</hi> (who is agreed to be the laſt Prophet) till <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> Which was for the ſpace of four hundred and odde years. Now 'tis ſufficiently evident that theſe Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books were all written after the time of <hi>Malachi,</hi> and ſo can be of no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Miſſion; And if any of them had been written before, and had been extant in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time (which they were not) it had been an unanſwerable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their Rejection now, Becauſe they were not received then. For, 'tis
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63973:202"/>well known that none of theſe Books now in queſtion were by Him incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the reſt of the Bible, nor were within the Canon at that time ſetled. That the Jews had no Prophets (by whom all parts of the Old-Teſtament were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: For the Church is built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; And the whole of the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called Prophecy) nor any Men of an Extraordinary Spirit amongſt them after the Captivity, both Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians generally agree. <hi>Joſephus</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in it; in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> he tells us, that from the time of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> though certain Books had been written, yet they deſerved not the ſame Credit and Belief that the Sacred Scriptures did, becauſe there was no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Prophers amongſt them. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> in the 45th Chapter of his 18th Book <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> ſheweth at large that the Jews had no Prophecy after <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s time. And the ſame, <hi>Euſebius</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth in his <hi>Demonſtrationes Evangelicae; Poſt Zachartam &amp; Malachiam non fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius apud Judaeos Prophetam; Et a reditu ex Captivitate ad tempora Servatoris nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum babucrint Judaei ſacrum Volumen.</hi> The
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:63973:202"/>Jews had no Prophets after <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> nor any Sacred Writings after the Captivity, till our Saviour's time. And ſome of theſe very Books tell us as much themſelves: For, in the firſt Book of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> Chap. 9. 'tis there ſaid, That there was then great Tribulation in Iſrael, ſuch as had not been ſince the dayes <hi>that there had been no Prophet in Iſrael,</hi> (relating to <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time.) And indeed it appears very plain from the Scripture it ſelf, that there were no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Writings publiſhed between the Prophecy of <hi>Malachi,</hi> and the writing of the Goſpels. For the Evangeliſts take things up juſt where he left them, and begin the Goſpel from the end of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachi</hi>'s Prophecy. For, he ending his Prophecy at <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> under the Type and Title of <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts beginning the Goſpel with Him, (for St. <hi>Mark</hi> expreſly declares the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Prophecy to be the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpel); There is a viſible combination from thence, from that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of Propheſie, of the Old and New Teſtament together.</p>
            <pb n="386" facs="tcp:63973:203"/>
            <p>Secondly, All the Writers of the Old Teſtament were Prophets to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to the Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and their Writings and Propheſies were directed chiefly to them. And ſo they were all writ (except ſome Paſſages in <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> that were written in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Dialect, to which the <hi>Jews</hi> had in their Captivity been much accuſtomed) in their own Native Language, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But theſe Books were confeſſedly moſt of them firſt written in <hi>Greek,</hi> and could be of no uſe at all to the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> nor underſtood by any but the diſperſed <hi>Helleniſts:</hi> And ſo were no way likely to be ſent from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to that Church, who never owned any Scripture for Canonical but what was in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> a Language peculiar to them. And the <hi>Bibles</hi> they conſtantly uſed till our Saviours time in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues were all in <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is, in moſt of theſe Books, ſome eminent diſcovery of their own Humane Extraction: As in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Macc.</hi> 2.24. The Author of that
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:63973:203"/>Book, whoever he were, tells us that he had borrowed what he wrote out of <hi>Jaſon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and contracted five Books of his into one Volumn. And ſo what he there wrote, he is ſo far from fathering it on the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or any Dictates of his, that he plainly confeſſeth 'twas none of his own, but the bare Epitomy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans Writings, and deſires to be excuſed if he had not done it well. And 'tis moſt notoriouſly evident to every common Reader, that many of theſe Books contain ſuch ridiculous Stories, and groſs Abſurdities, that without high impiety, and great contradiction to all thoſe Natural Notions we have of God, they cannot be imputed to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> as their Author.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Theſe Books were never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> into their Canon, nor are to this day: And ſo, during the times of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were never received by any Church, (for there was then no other) which is moſt abſurd to conceive of any parts of God's Written and Supream Laws; As alſo that the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom in a moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:63973:204"/>way the Oracles of God were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and who had the cuſtody of all God's Sacred Records, and were (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls them) God's &amp; the Churches great <hi>Library-Keepers,</hi> ſhould ſo notoriouſly err, as to reject (for, not to receive into their Canon is to reject) ſo great a part of the Bible. 'Tis ſomewhat ſtrange that thoſe of the Roman Church (with whom chiefly we conteſt in this Matter, and who annex to the Church an infallible Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſhould imagine the Church of the Jews to fall into ſo great and groſs a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in ſo fundamental a matter. That the Jewiſh Church never heretofore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived theſe Apocryphal Books into their Canon, nor do to this day, is a thing that with the leaſt colour of Reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed. That they do not to this day, is known all the World over, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Jews are: And their Bibles are to be ſeen. That the Ancient Church of the Jews, before the times of our Saviour, had no other Books within their Canon, than thoſe we now have, is evident from the teſtimony of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in his firſt Book againſt <hi>Appion,</hi> who there t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lls us what Books the Jews reckoned
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:63973:204"/>Canonical, and ſayes, They are onely twenty two in number, (according to the number of Letters in their Alphabet); and reckons thoſe very Books we now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as onely Canonical; Other Books, he ſayes, there were written after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, but they were never numbred with the Sacred Records. <hi>Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and many other of the Chriſtian Writers have largely proved the ſame. Thoſe of the Roman Church, who have turn'd every Stone to eaſe themſelves from the dint of this <hi>Argument,</hi> have found no other countenance that ever theſe Books receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Jews, to make us ſuppoſe they received them into their Canon, but that in ſome places, ſome few of the <hi>Helleniſt Jews</hi> that lived remote from <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> had annexed ſome of theſe <hi>Books</hi> to their <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint Bibles.</hi> But ſuch <hi>Helleniſts</hi> themſelves had any eſteem of them as Canonical Writings: Nor can it any more be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thence that they had, than it can, That we in <hi>England</hi> receive them into our Canon, becauſe they are bound up with ſome of our <hi>Bibles.</hi> And never were any of theſe Books annexed to the <hi>Hobrew-Bibles</hi> uſed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:63973:205"/>
               <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> nor were any of them ever read or admitted into their Synagogues there. In truth, This matter, in point of Fact, is ſo notorious and evident, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf makes an ingenuous confeſſion of it, and ſayes plainly, <hi>Hos omnes Libros</hi> (ſpeaking of theſe Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books) <hi>ad unum rejici ab Hebraeis,</hi> That every one of theſe Books were rected by the Church of the Jews, <hi>Contr.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 10. And confirms the ſame out of St. <hi>Jerome.</hi> And if ſo, we have then not only the judgment of the Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church in this caſe, (which is ſingly ſufficient: For, 'twere a ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to make any Books part of the Old Teſtament now, which were not ſo received then). But we have alſo a more infallible determination; For our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and the Apoſtles fully and conſtantly approved the Old Teſtament, as the Jews were then poſſeſſed of it. 'Twere abſurd to ſuppoſe that our Saviour ſhould with ſo much exactneſs, reduce all to the Rule of the Scripture, and yet tacitly approve, and ſilently paſs over ſo great a miſtake about the Rule it ſelf. Our Saviour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the Jews to ſearch the Scriptures as
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:63973:205"/>they then had them, as being perfect and compleat: Appeals to their own Bibles upon all occaſions in his own defence: Expounded <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the Prophets, as thoſe to whom he ſpake were acquainted with them, and as they were then extant; Nay, he himſelf read and preached in their Synagogues out of the Scriptures, as he there found them, and as they were there publickly uſed. And no man can ſoberly imagine that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would go about to inſtruct the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of any falſe and imperfect Rule. The Apoſtles likewiſe upon all occaſions made uſe of the Old Teſtament as they found the Jews poſſeſſed of it; Nor have we the leaſt intimation that the Jews were either miſtaken in the number of thoſe Books they received, or that the leaſt alteration had been made in thoſe Books, ſince the times wherein they were firſt written.</p>
            <p>And 'tis as evident that the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as the Jews then had it, and as our Saviour and the Apoſtles approved it) deſcended down to the Chriſtian Church, and was conſtantly ſo received. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Writers agree univerſally in it.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:63973:206"/>
               <hi>Cyprian, Epiphanius, Athanaſius, Nazianzen,</hi> all bear witneſs to it. <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> after he has reckoned up to his <hi>Catechumini,</hi> the 22 Books of the Old Teſtament we now receive, adds, <hi>Hos lege viginti duos; Cum Apocryphis nil habe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotii,</hi> Catechiſ. 4. <hi>Read theſe two and twenty Books; But meddle not with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha. Origen,</hi> quoted for it at large by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in his Hiſtory, reckons up the very ſame twenty two Books for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical parts of the Old Teſtament: And ſo does St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and expreſly reckons the other <hi>Apocryphal.</hi> The ſame we find in <hi>Ruſſinus,</hi> who ſayes, The <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Books they never antiently called <hi>Libros Canonicos,</hi> but <hi>Eccleſiaſticos.</hi> And the firſt Council we read of that entred into a conſideration of this Matter, which was that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> about the year 364. in their 59 <hi>Canon,</hi> declare the Canonical Books of the Old Teſtament to be the very ſame, and no other then thoſe we now receive. Nor were theſe Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books ever otherwiſe reckoned, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Church, than as humane and fallible Writings, till the late Aſſembly at <hi>Trent</hi> were pleaſed to declare them otherwiſe.</p>
            <pb n="393" facs="tcp:63973:206"/>
            <p>Theſe things muſt needs ſeem ſufficient to any reaſonable man to clear up that doubt on the one hand, Whether we have not leſs in our <hi>Bibles</hi> than we indeed ought to have! Becauſe that beſides what the Roman Church hath of late done to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize theſe Apochryphal Writings, no other addition to the Bible has been at any time attempted, that merits the leaſt conſideration. I proceed to the doubt on the other hand: And that is, How we may be reaſonably ſecured, that our <hi>Bibles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in them no more then they ſhould! That is, upon what ground we receive ſome Books in the New Teſtament! The Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James,</hi> the ſecond Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> the 2 and 3 Epiſtles of <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps!</hi> Of all which there has formerly been ſome doubt made! In the ſolution of which, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour theſe two things: Firſt, To ſhew what were moſt probably the firſt and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal grounds of ſuch Doubts! And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To ſhew that thoſe doubts then ought to be of no prevalency with us now; And that there is, at this time, no good reaſon to make the leaſt doubt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the New Teſtament, as we are
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:63973:207"/>now in poſſeſſion of it. All the Doubts that have ariſen about any parts of the New Teſtament, were moſt probably theſe two wayes occaſioned. Firſt, 'Tis obvious that the New Teſtament was writ in ſeveral parts, at ſeveral times, and not all compoſed together. The Whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not publick but by many ſteps and degrees: Had ſeveral former and latter Editions; That is, ſome parts that were firſt writ, were copyed out by thoſe that had the Originals, and con-joyn'd, and ſo diſpers'd: And other parts ſtill added as they were written, and became publick. Now 'tis eaſie to conceive that ſome parts that were after added to ſuch Bibles as firſt came out, might be at firſt queſtioned and doubted of, by ſuch who had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Editions, and were not fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed about the after Addition of other parts. And ſo it has fallen out in the publication of moſt Syſtemes of Humane Laws that have come out gradually and by parts, and not in a full and intire Body at once. Secondly, 'Tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that many Chriſtians that lived in thoſe firſt Times, by reaſon of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from thoſe places where ſome parts of the New Teſtament firſt became pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63973:207"/>might be, for a conſiderable time, it may be till after the deaths of their Authors) without any notice of them; And upon that account ſome doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch parts might ariſe, becauſe they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad come to their knowledge no ſooner, eſpecially if any ſuch parts ſeemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avour or countenance any particular Sect or Opinion, as the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> did that of the <hi>Novations,</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alyps</hi> that of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi>). And this is moſt likely to be the true reaſon why ſome of the Epiſtles (and we know 'twas about the Epiſtles that the doubts chiefly were) were at any time queſtioned, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch as were more remotely, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly directed to the ſcattered Jews, as that of St. <hi>James,</hi> that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which were no way likely to be ſo ſoon, or ſo commonly known to the generality of Chriſtians; Nor could they be ſo eaſie to come by as thoſe Epiſtles ſent to <hi>Rome, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and thoſe great and publick Cities, from whence the fame of them would ſoon ſpread; and Copies were upon much eaſier terms to be had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'twas certainly known where the Originals were.</p>
            <pb n="396" facs="tcp:63973:208"/>
            <p>Secondly. There is no good Reaſon, from any Queſtion that was made hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to raiſe any Doubts now about any Parts of the New-Teſtament; And that for theſe three Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe theſe Books in queſtion were moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received at firſt, and doubted of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſome, and thoſe ſuch who had leaſt information about them. And this is very evident; Becauſe we find them fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently quoted, as Canonical Scripture, by many of the moſt ancient Chriſtian-Writers, in thoſe Ages next the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. <hi>Tertullian</hi> (except the ſecond Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St. <hi>Peter</hi>) hath in his Works quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as Canonical Scripture, every Book of the New-Teſtament we now receive. And St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> ſpeaking in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Dardan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m</hi> of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Heb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ews,</hi> and ſome other of thoſe Books about which we now diſcourſe, ſayes, <hi>We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them not from the Cuſtom of this Time, but from the Authority of the moſt Primitive Writers.</hi> Secondly, They contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them but what does plainly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize with the reſt of the Bible, and is generally witneſſed unto by other Books, about which no queſtion hath been at any time made. And of this there can
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:63973:208"/>be no doubt, unleſs it be concerning the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which yet contains a moſt Admirable, though Myſterious Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and divers other parts of the Bible. And to this Book (beſides that the ſuitableneſs of Events thereunto, and the notorious ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of many Prophetical paſſages in it, has put its Divine Authority out of all queſtion) we have as great a Teſtimony from Antiquity, as can in ſuch a caſe well be expected. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who lived very near the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> himſelf, in his Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon,</hi> cites it as the Writing of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and without the leaſt queſtion, aſcribes it to him. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who lived ſome ſmall time after <hi>Juſtin,</hi> and was the Scholar of <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who was the Scholar of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) ſayes poſitively, 'Twas written by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle. And that he was well aſſured thereof from ſome (moſt probably <hi>Polycarp</hi>) that had ſeen the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelf, and perſonally converſed with him. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. and <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. And <hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ertullian</hi> in his 4th Book againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> ſayes, <hi>Though</hi> Marcion <hi>did reject the Apocalyps as none of St.</hi> John<hi>'s, yet</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the ſucceſſion of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:63973:209"/>Biſhops tracod to the beginning, will eſtabliſh Him as the certain and undoubted Author of it.</hi> Thirdly, God has, in a providential way, determined this matter. For, thoſe that at firſt queſtioned thoſe Books (when the heat of primitive Perſecutions were ſomewhat abated, the Church had free intercourſe and communication together, and came to be better informed) received them: All doubts about them are now vaniſhed. <hi>Luthur,</hi> and ſome with him in <hi>Germany</hi> (who were the laſt that revived any doubts of that kind) upon ſecond and more deliberate thoughts, recanted their Error. All Chriſtians are now at an Agreement about them (the Supreameſt Eſtabliſhment that can be of Canonical-Authority) even the Roman Church themſelves receive the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> into their Canon, although many paſſages in it ſeem very particularly directed againſt them. Indeed, the heavenly luſtre of theſe Books is broke forth like the Sun in his ſtrength, has over-ſpred the whole Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of the Chriſtian Church; And where ever the Goſpel is owned, theſe Books are received with that Veneration that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes due to ſuch Sacred Writings.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Judges the doubts that have been at any time made about any parts of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> not worthy of our Notice. And therefore in the ſixth Article it is thus expreſſed. <hi>In the Name of the holy Scriptures we do underſtand thoſe Canonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament, of whoſe Authority was never any doubt in the Church.</hi> That is, no <hi>conſiderable</hi> doubt; no <hi>general</hi> doubt in the <hi>Whole Church;</hi> Nor indeed any ſuch doubt as ought to diſturb either the <hi>Churches determination,</hi> or any particular mans judgment about this matter. For it cannot be ſhewed that any <hi>One intire Church,</hi> or that any <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Provincial Council,</hi> or indeed that any Conſiderable part of the <hi>Christian</hi> World, in any Publick <hi>Confeſſions, Catechiſms,</hi> or otherwiſe, have <hi>rejected any</hi> of thoſe <hi>Books</hi> we now reckon within the <hi>Canon.</hi> The moſt Conſiderable Doubt that we find made about any one of them was, about the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which for ſome time was doubted of in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> And yet <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays onely, It was doubted of <hi>a quibuſdam in Eccleſia Romana,</hi> by ſome in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> and 'tis certain, much of that doubt was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther St. <hi>Paul</hi> were the <hi>Authour</hi> of it or no? But to conclude an Anſwer to this Queſtion, let theſe two things be Conſidered. Firſt,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:63973:210"/>under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſo ſoon as all the Parts of it were finiſhed, the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>That</hi> was exactly ſettled by men of an <hi>infallible Spirit,</hi> in the times of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and thoſe laſt Prophets contemporary with him; and ſo no further Doubt was, or could reaſonably be made about that. Secondly, under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> it pleaſed God ſo to order it, that he that cloſed up the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> and wrote the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of it, ſo far <hi>out-lived</hi> all the other <hi>Pen-men,</hi> that he himſelf might very well ſee the <hi>Whole conjoyned,</hi> and deliver it over to the <hi>Church, intire</hi> as we now have it. The Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> not onely ſurvived <hi>Titus,</hi> and that famous <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> in his time, but he lived through <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time, and <hi>Cocceius Nerva</hi>'s time, to the Reign of the <hi>Emperour Trajan,</hi> which was ſomewhat above a Hundred years after our <hi>Saviours</hi> Birth, and ſixty and odd after his <hi>Crucifixion;</hi> ſo <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 192. And <hi>ſome other</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> it ſhould ſeem lived long; for the ſame Author ſays, that there were in his time <hi>Saniores qui non ſolum Johannem viderint ſed &amp; alios Apostolos: Elders that had not onely ſeen S.

Tertullian, de Preſcript.</hi> ſays expreſly, <hi>The Canon of the Bible is founded upon Apoſtolical Authority.</hi> And <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives this plain teſtimony to it, <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant veteres Johannem Aſiaticarum Eccleſiarum rogatu, Germanum Scripturae Canonem conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe.

Conſidering the Doubts that were then extant about ſome Parts, amongſt
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:63973:211"/>ſuch as had not a thorough Information about them, and that <hi>Falſe apoſtles</hi> did then appear, conſidering of how great a Concern it was then, and would be to all future Ages to have the <hi>Canon</hi> of the whole <hi>Bible</hi> ſettled by an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible judgment;</hi> and conſidering the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Evidence we have from many <hi>Primative Writers,</hi> That indeed it was ſo. All theſe things conſidered, there ſeemes very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ground to believe that the <hi>Apoſtle John</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left the world, did fully Determine this matter; and 'tis moſt likely, <hi>that as the Knowledge</hi> of what <hi>he</hi> had done came to be publiſhed abroad, the <hi>Doubts</hi> that were then made <hi>diſ-appeared.</hi> And we that live in theſe latter Ages ſee that all the Queſtions and Doubts that have at any time been, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>vaniſhed,</hi> and the whole <hi>bopy</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> hath now gained an <hi>Univerſal recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>How can we that have not the</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals <hi>of the Scriptures, not the</hi> Outogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha<hi>'s of thoſe that Wrote them, but onely the</hi> Copies <hi>of them, and most but the</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations <hi>of thoſe</hi> Copies, <hi>reſt aſsured we have Gods Mind as it was firſt delivered?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="404" facs="tcp:63973:212"/>
            <p>In Anſwering to this Queſtion, it muſt be acknowledged that the <hi>Original Records</hi> of every Part of the <hi>Bible</hi> did at firſt conſiſt of <hi>Periſhable matter,</hi> and have undergone the common Fate of all oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r Writings. 'Tis evident it was not the pleaſure of God that the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſhould be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated ſingly in them, but be of a much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Extenſion, and of a perpetual Duration. 'Tis not to be doubted but that the <hi>Apographa</hi>'s <hi>Copies</hi> truely taken from the <hi>Originals</hi> of any part of the <hi>Bible,</hi> were of equal <hi>Authority</hi> with the <hi>Originals</hi> themſelves. 'Twas not the <hi>Paper,</hi> nor the <hi>Ink,</hi> nor the <hi>Hand</hi> wherein they were writ, nor any thing Circumſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of that kind, but the <hi>Matter</hi> it ſelf, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that gave Authority to them. And whereſoever that <hi>Matter</hi> is truely contained, there is alſo the ſame <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> preſent. The great Queſtion in theſe dayes will be, Whether thoſe Copies we have of the Scriptures in thoſe <hi>Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> in which they were firſt Writ, be <hi>True!</hi> and whether they have not been ſince <hi>Defaced</hi> or <hi>Corrupted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Satisfaction that ought to be given to this Inquiry, muſt ariſe theſe two wayes; Firſt by conſidering the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themſelves in their preſent poſture; And Secondly, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63973:212"/>ſuch <hi>Circumſtances</hi> as attended their firſt Tranſcription, and the <hi>various Copies</hi> that were then, and have been ſince, taken of them. I begin with the <hi>Latter.</hi> Firſt, the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> we know was delivered over as it firſt became written to the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and committed by God himſelf to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody: And 'twas <hi>they</hi> alone that had the Care incumbent upon them, punctually to <hi>Tranſcribe,</hi> and ſafely to ſecure it. That they performed this Truſt with great Care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, and delivered the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> over <hi>intire</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> we have good cauſe to believe: and that both upon general, and ſome more particular ground. Firſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on General ground; 'Tis notorious that the <hi>Jews</hi> had the higheſt value imaginable of their <hi>Law,</hi> and prized it above <hi>all</hi> elſe they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. Both <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo</hi> tell us, that the <hi>Jews</hi> would rather have ſuffered a thouſand Deaths, then that the leaſt thing ſhould be once <hi>altered</hi> in the <hi>Divine Laws</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of their Nation. The miraculous power upon which the firſt Foundation of it was Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, had imprinted in that People an <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible veneration</hi> of it. Secondly, it was the <hi>Municipal Law</hi> of their Countrey, and that by which all matters of right were daily Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, and by which each mans Property a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:63973:213"/>them was maintained and ſecured. Thirdly, their <hi>Law</hi> was not onely the <hi>Glory</hi> of their Nation, and the Foundation of their Political and Eccleſiaſtical being, but it was alſo the great Title they had to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The <hi>Scriptures</hi> contained in themſelves the <hi>Deeds</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> himſelf conveyed to them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and gave them the higheſt Right to poſſeſs it. 'Tis not hard from hence to conceive that the <hi>Jews</hi> would be care<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful of ſuch a Book, wherein their <hi>Bodies,</hi> their <hi>Souls,</hi> their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> their <hi>Honour,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their <hi>All</hi> was ſo much concerned. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it appears more <hi>particularly</hi> and in <hi>fact</hi> that they were ſo; For after that by Gods Providential diſpoſal, <hi>Ezra</hi> and that Famous <hi>Synagogue</hi> with him, had exactly ſettled their <hi>Canon,</hi> and delivered over the <hi>Scriptures</hi> pure and intire to the People at their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the indefatigable Care of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Maſtori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:63973:213"/>that the leaſt conſiderable <hi>Alteration</hi> or <hi>Change</hi> could at any time be made in it. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks with great Wonder of the Induſtry and Care of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this matter, <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile mihi videtur</hi> (ſays he) <hi>duobus annorum mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It ſeems wonderful to me, that for the ſpace of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years and upward (for I cannot exactly rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the number of years) not ſo much as one word ſhould be Changed in their Law, but that every Jew would rather dye a hundred times over, then dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in the leaſt from it.</hi> And that this care of the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> was, by Gods bleſſing effectual and ſucceſsful for the ſecuring of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> from all <hi>maime</hi> or <hi>Imperfection,</hi> and the leaſt conſiderable <hi>alteration</hi> from what it <hi>was</hi> when it was firſt Delivered; There needs no other Evidence then that our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> fully <hi>approved</hi> it as the <hi>Jews</hi> were then in poſſeſſion of it, and never charged them with the leaſt Guilt either of <hi>Corruption</hi> or <hi>Neglect</hi> in that kind.

Nor do we ever ſuppoſe that any Book that haſ paſſed through many handſ and been often Tranſcribed, to be <hi>totally</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trupted or Changed, becauſe in ſome placeſ of it we find <hi>variouſ Lectionſ,</hi> but are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much ſecured that ſuch Bookſ have not been Deſignedly Altered; And with good reaſon do judge that ſuch variouſ Lectionſ are barely the effectſ of <hi>caſual miſtakeſ,</hi> and that the Original ſenſe of the Authour iſ ſtill preſerved, and may, by a careful and diligent inſpection be found out amongſt them. And indeed, thoſe we find of ſome Textſ in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are of ſuch a nature, that they all evidently appear the effectſ of humane <hi>frailty,</hi> and onely ſuch variationſ, aſ might (conſidering how vaſt a number of Copieſ were at firſt taken) eſcape the <hi>beſt ſcribeſ,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>diligence.</hi> Nor iſ there the leaſt appearance of any Deſign or Contrivance to <hi>

'Tis in this caſe, of great Conſideration, That no Particular deſigns of any bad men have been <hi>gratified,</hi> nor any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Ends <hi>attained;</hi> nor indeed any Diſtinct Ends at all, of any ſort, by any ſuch <hi>diverſity</hi> of <hi>readings:</hi> which ſufficiently ſhews they came not originally from <hi>Contrivement,</hi> nor were <hi>Intended</hi> as the Foundation of any particular <hi>Notions,</hi> but are the bare and ſingle effects of <hi>Accident.</hi> That the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> therefore has been in any Part of it, wholly <hi>changed</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,</hi> there appeareth neither Certain not Probable ground to believe. Nor indeed is there any good ground to believe that theſe <hi>Sacred Records</hi> have ſuffered the leaſt <hi>violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in this kind. Firſt, no man can prove that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were ever <hi>Corrupted,</hi> nor tell us by <hi>whom,</hi> or <hi>When,</hi> or the manner <hi>How!</hi> which yet ought to be done, if men will Reaſonably Object in this caſe; For no ſuch Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this (that renders God in his Providence ſo Regardleſs of his Word, and his <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo Reproches the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion</hi> that has been in ſuch a Succeſſion Eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of this Book) ought ever to be admitted without very poſitive <hi>Proof:</hi>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:63973:217"/>Eſpecially when we have ſuch apparent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to believe the contrary. By Whom is it, I ask, that the <hi>Bible</hi> could be <hi>corrupted?</hi> It muſt have been either by <hi>Jews, Pagans,</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> 'Tis plain the <hi>Jews</hi> have not done it; for we find multitudes of Texts that give in a daily witneſs againſt them, which doubtleſs had they attempted the <hi>Bible</hi> in ſuch a way, they would never have ſuffered ſo to remain upon Record againſt them. No part of the <hi>Pagan</hi> World can be reaſonably thought to have done it: for the Scriptures contain ſuch an eminent Revelation of the <hi>One true God</hi> and his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as puts an end to <hi>all Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh vanities,</hi> and at once diſpatches all <hi>Falſe gods</hi> out of the world. Nor have <hi>Hereticks</hi> done it; for 'tis this <hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> the Written <hi>Word of God,</hi> that upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mortally wounds them: the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have ſlain their thouſands and their ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in this kind. 'Tis the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> in aſſerting the Orthodox Truths of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that has in all Ages kept up the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Verity,</hi> and ſtill brought all ſorts of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> to an open ſhame. It has been the <hi>Wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or <hi>Perverting,</hi> not the <hi>Corrupting</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> from whence all <hi>Hereſies</hi> have chiefly ariſen; and the native and genuine <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> has ſtill proved their Ruine. Nor
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:63973:218"/>is there upon the whole of this matter, any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Reaſon to Doubt but that as God was pleaſed by his ſpecial Providence to Secure the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> (which we are ſure he did) and preſerve it intire till the time of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> ſo by the ſame Providence he has ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New</hi> ſince, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them over to the <hi>Church</hi> in theſe latter Ages without any conſiderable <hi>variation</hi> from what they were when they were firſt written. And this ought to be duely conſidered, as an eminent help towards a rational Satisfaction in this point, That the very ſame <hi>Objections</hi> which ſome men now pleaſe themſelves with againſt the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> was equally lyable to, in the times of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Apostles.</hi> For after <hi>Eſdras</hi>'s time, the <hi>Old Testament</hi> came into no <hi>Infallible bands</hi> till the times of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>fallible means</hi> through many Ages down to thoſe times, had the ſame poſſibilities of <hi>Alteration</hi> then, that the <hi>New Testament</hi> has now; Various <hi>Lections</hi> alſo in the <hi>Hebrew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi> were then extant: And yet for all this, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> were then <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>intire:</hi> Nor does our <hi>Saviour</hi> or the <hi>Apoſtoles</hi> mention the leaſt <hi>defect</hi> that was then in them: Nor was there in thoſe eminent times of Reformation, the leaſt Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:63973:218"/>or doubt ever raiſed upon any ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>One grand <hi>Objection</hi> is uſually made upon the whole of this matter, and 'tis thus framed. All theſe Arguments brought either to prove the <hi>Bible</hi> in general, or to anſwer ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colar doubts as ariſe about it, are built (ſay ſome) upon no better foundation then <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>,</hi> and in themſelves <hi>fallible</hi> grounds: And if ſo, we ſtill embrace our <hi>Religion,</hi> but upon uncertain terms; can never from chance arrive at any poſitive and abſolute aſſurance, nor come to ſuch a <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible faith</hi> as we ought to have in this caſe.</p>
            <p>In anſwering to this Objection, this muſt be acknowledged, that although the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were at firſt <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by the <hi>infallible</hi> guidance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet the manner of their <hi>Conveyance</hi> to future Ages has been by <hi>Humane,</hi> and in themſelves <hi>fallible</hi> means. The Grounds and Reaſons of which diſpoſal of God, though we cannot pretend fully to reach, yet we are thus far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; Firſt, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> could not have been by means in themſelves abſolutely <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llible,</hi> handed down to all Places and Ages, without the viſible continuance and conſtant exertion of ſuch a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> and <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power</hi> as would have wholly inverted that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63973:219"/>courſe we find God moſt generally takes in his Rule and diſpoſe of the World. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would have prevented all that caſe and induſtry God intended to exerciſe his Church withall to their great advantage) in the exact preſervation of theſe ſacred <hi>Records.</hi> Thirdly, there had been no room for a belief of, not occaſion for a dependance upon that Wiſdom and Power God has expreſſed, and wherein he has greatly honoured himſelf, in an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling diſpoſal of <hi>ordinary means</hi> to ſuch <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Ends,</hi> who has providentially ſecured this Book through all the ſeveral Channels of <hi>Humane</hi> conveyance.</p>
            <p>This Objection is much urged; Firſt, by thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> on the one hand, to convince us of the great uncertainty of our own profeſſion, and the ſtability of theirs. And Secondly, by men of <hi>Sceptical</hi> Principles on the other hand, either to fright or perſwade us, or both, out of all <hi>Religion,</hi> by telling us. There is no poſitive or abſolute <hi>certainty</hi> in the grounds of <hi>any.</hi> How ſerviceable this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (though it has filled the World with great noiſe and clamour, as it has been preſſed both ways) will prove to either of theſe deſigns, and indeed with how great abſurdity tis mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in order to both, will be ſoon made to appear.</p>

Now <hi>Divine faith,</hi> in that beſt and trueſt ſenſe of it, will be reduced into no more then a <hi>Moral a ſsurance</hi> at laſt; for, if I ſay my faith is Divine, becauſe built upon a <hi>Divine Teſtimony,</hi> 'tis in ſome ſenſe true: But if I am asked, by what means I came to <hi>know</hi> that Teſtimony to be Divine! That queſtion muſt needs bring me back to a <hi>Moral aſſurance</hi> as the ground of all my previous belief about that Divine Teſtimony it ſelf, that it really is ſo. Whatſoever <hi>Revelation</hi> God makes of his mind to me, I muſt needs without Divine aſſiſtance receive it upon <hi>Humane,</hi> and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>fallible</hi> terms, and ſo judge of it as I judg of all other things. No man can receive my Revelation from God, with a faith a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and infallible as the Revelation is in it ſelf, unleſs there be an <hi>equal inſpiration</hi> in both caſes, and God make men as infallible
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:63973:220"/>in <hi>Judging</hi> of Revelation when propoſed, as he made the Inſtruments of it in the Act of its <hi>Conveyance.</hi> The plain Queſtion, in this Caſe, is how I come to receive all other things into my belief that are Objects of belief? It muſt be confeſſed, upon the grounds of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> credibility and <hi>Moral aſſurance;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the ſame terms muſt I believe all things <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural,</hi> unleſs God give me new <hi>faculties,</hi> or ſome way extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily aſſiſt me, and make me ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> then I <hi>was.</hi> Nor did any man that was not himſelf <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were) and inſpired infallibly to know that he was ſo, ever receive any Revelation upon any higher terms then that we call <hi>Moral</hi> aſſurance, and <hi>Humane</hi> credibility. For firſt, If I receive a Revelation upon Motives <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> to it ſelf, ſuch Motives are all granted to be in themſelves of a <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>fallible</hi> Nature. If I receive it upon any Motives <hi>Internal,</hi> any Teſtimony reſulting from ſuch Revelation it ſelf, to juſtifie its own Divinity to me, yet I muſt of neceſſity (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inſpiration) judge of ſuch Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Teſtimony, by <hi>Moral conſiderations,</hi> and from <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Rational Argumentation</hi> with my ſelf, come at laſt to make a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about it. Thoſe that lived in the firſt
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63973:220"/>times, that ſaw the Miracles, and heard the Doctrine delivered from the mouths of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, were yet (without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration) but upon <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>fallible</hi> terms of <hi>judging</hi> and <hi>believing;</hi> becauſe thoſe <hi>Mediums</hi> by which they did judge and believe, were in their own Nature ſo; for, 'tis not a thing in it ſelf infallibly certain, but that any man may be miſtaken in the judgement he makes of a <hi>Miracle,</hi> or in that faith whereby he embraces any Doctrine as <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Objection, as 'tis urged by thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> does not diſturb us at all. Indeed, returns directly upon themſelves, nor does the remedy they provide, any way cure that inconveniency which they ſuppoſe will otherwiſe accrue to Religion by it; They tell us, God has placed an <hi>unerring Judgement,</hi> a <hi>faculty</hi> of making an <hi>infallible determination</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> and from thence this Objection is Anſwered, by that means we are perfectly at an end of all doubts about this matter; for, if the <hi>Church,</hi> that is in it ſelf <hi>Infallible,</hi> tells us, that this is the word of God, and as it was at firſt delivered, we come upon that account to a <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible faith,</hi> as built upon a Divine and Infallible Teſtimony, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly aſſured about it. But this kind of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning brings us but juſt where we were, and
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:63973:221"/>is indeed in it ſelf but a very mean ſort of trifling; for, 'tis to erect <hi>another infallibility,</hi> to be aſſured of which there is ten times greater difficulty then in the former caſe. The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (we ſay) are in themſelves <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> as coming from God; The Queſtion is, about out <hi>way</hi> of coming to <hi>know</hi> this, that they are ſo. 'Tis confeſſed by us, it muſt be without inſpiration by means in themſelves <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Fallible,</hi> and from thence reſults the ſtrength of this Objection: That ſuppoſing the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be in themſelves <hi>Divine,</hi> yet we coming in a <hi>Humane way</hi> to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> that they are ſo, and to ſolve all Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, our belief of them is ſtill reſolved into no more then that we call a <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Rational credibility.</hi> And do we not come to the very <hi>ſame</hi> point in the <hi>other caſe?</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> (ſay they) is <hi>Divinely inſpired;</hi> but how came I to <hi>know</hi> it? To ſay, by the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> is in this caſe ridiculous; If upon <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential</hi> and <hi>Probable</hi> Motives (as themſelves do acknowledge) we are thereby pitched upon a <hi>fallible bottom</hi> ſtill; are we not upon the ſame Humane and Fallible means of judging; 'Tis not enough in this caſe to make the <hi>Pope</hi> or any elſe <hi>Infallible;</hi> but before we can that way perfectly enervate this Objection, we muſt make <hi>every man</hi> infallibly to <hi>know</hi> that they are
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63973:221"/>ſo infallible. Can any man more infallibly judge of the <hi>Churches infallibility</hi> then of the <hi>Bibles?</hi> Are there not as many, nay more que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that muſt neceſſarily be determined by Fallibly and Humanely judging in the <hi>one Caſe</hi> then in the <hi>other?</hi> as firſt whether there actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be any ſuch thing as an infallible Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant or no; Secondly, if there be, what Church it is that is ſo; and Thirdly, whether that Church be univerſally infallible, or only in ſome things; and under what ſort of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it muſt be, when it ſo infallibly acts; ſo that, admit the <hi>Churches infallibility</hi> in it ſelf, yet 'tis utterly impoſſible that a man ſhould believe any thing upon its infallible determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with any other then a <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Fallible Faith;</hi> becauſe 'tis upon Humane and Fallible <hi>Motives</hi> upon which men prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and previouſly come to an aſſurance of ſuch <hi>infallibility.</hi> And therefore, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faith in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is grounded upon the <hi>Churches infallible Judgement,</hi> it muſt unavoidably be ultimately reſolved into ſuch Grounds as are in themſelves of a Humane and fallible Nature. So that the <hi>Roman infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> as 'tis in it ſelf an abſurd and fictitious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, ſo were it admitted, 'tis to no purpoſe at all for that end for which 'tis intended, ſo far as 'tis urged in this matter.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> a rational Belief of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and a rational Satisfaction about it, founded in a Moral aſſurance, is all we <hi>can have,</hi> and all that in this caſe we ought to <hi>expect.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all ſuch Objectors, by what means they come to any Aſſurance in <hi>any Point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion!</hi> To one of theſe three things they will be unavoidably forced: Either to deny that there is <hi>any certainty</hi> at all in Religion, and thereby to ſubvert <hi>all Religion:</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to extraordinary <hi>Inſpiration;</hi> or elſe to acknowledge they come to it in a <hi>Moral way.</hi> And indeed the founding our belief of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation upon <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Rational Aſſurance,</hi> is ſo far from ſubverting the <hi>certainty</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that the grand Fundamentals of <hi>all Religion</hi> muſt of neceſſity be originally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon that Bottom, and can be upon no other; for we come to an Aſſurance of the <hi>Being</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the future ſtate of mens <hi>Souls,</hi> upon no other Grounds then <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Rational concluſions,</hi> from whence there can poſſibly reſult no more then a <hi>Moral Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</hi> Whoever attemps a Rational proof of the Being of God, is obliged to diſclaim all pretence to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> of his <hi>Proof;</hi> becauſe <hi>Infalibility</hi> is wholly relative to <hi>God himſelf:</hi> The notion of it cannot exiſt without the admiſſion of ſuch a <hi>Being;</hi> and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63973:222"/>therefore to talk of an <hi>Infalible</hi> way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Being, would be groſly abſurd; for 'twere openly to <hi>beg</hi> the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and take that for <hi>granted</hi> which we oblige our ſelves to <hi>prove.</hi> So that whoever upon rational terms and the grounds of Moral Aſſurance, believe the <hi>Bible</hi> to be ſent us from <hi>God,</hi> believes it upon the ſame Grounds upon which he muſt neceſſarily believe the firſt Principles of all Religion, and believe it upon the <hi>higheſt terms</hi> God either requires or enables him without Inſpiration to believe it; upon ſuch as ought ſufficiently to fix him in his <hi>belief,</hi> and upon ſuch as if duely purſued, will certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all thoſe excellent ends God intends by this <hi>Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may ſerve, in ſome meaſure, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the <hi>vanity</hi> of all pretenſions to an <hi>Infali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble belief</hi> (without a Divine and Infalible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance) of <hi>revealed</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Truths, and the Miſtakes of ſuch, who ſuppoſe we can never be ſettled in any Points of Religion without it: And may ſufficiently juſtify an indeavour to make a <hi>Rational proof</hi> of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> without a pretence to any ſuch <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infalible</hi> Judgment about them. If ſo much be urged for the Proof of the <hi>Bible</hi> in general, and in Anſwer to particular Doubts relating to the manner of its <hi>conveyance,</hi> as
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:63973:223"/>will amount to a <hi>rational aſſurance</hi> and <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;</hi> 'Tis all we can have without <hi>Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and all we ought to <hi>Expect</hi> in this caſe. All we pretend to from attempts of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is but a <hi>Moral aſſurance</hi> that this <hi>Book</hi> was at firſt written by <hi>Gods direction,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Copies</hi> we now have of it, are without any <hi>deſigned corruption,</hi> or other <hi>variation</hi> from the firſt <hi>Originals</hi> (then what humane frailty in the Tranſcribing of them has occaſioned) deſcended down to us: and that in all ſuch places where we find various <hi>readings,</hi> the true <hi>Senſe</hi> of the place, and the original <hi>Dictates</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are amongſt <hi>them all</hi> ſafely <hi>preſerved,</hi> and by a diligent ſearch may be <hi>diſcovered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon the ſame Grounds of <hi>Moral Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</hi> are men in point of <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> and all ſuch who are Illiterate. For, as we can be without extraordinary aſſiſtance but Morally certain that the <hi>Bible</hi> was Original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Written by a <hi>divine direction,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>Copies</hi> we now have of it in the <hi>Original Languages,</hi> were at firſt Rightly <hi>tranſcribed,</hi> and have not been ſince <hi>corrupted</hi> or <hi>changed,</hi> ſo men may be alſo Morally Certain about a <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> For 'tis in it ſelf a thing very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> may, out of their own Languages, be truely and rightly <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated</hi>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:63973:223"/>(and being ſo, are of the ſame <hi>Divine Authority</hi> that they were before) and upon circumſtantial conſiderations men may come rationally and ſafety to conclude that they are ſo. And indeed, unleſs all men in an Age that underſtand the <hi>Original tongues,</hi> ſhould <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> (which is abſurd to conceive, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible to be) to <hi>deceive</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> thoſe that do not; no Deſigned abuſe nor any palpable falſhood can be impoſed upon men that way. And in like manner, perſons <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate</hi> may be Morally Certain that they are no way deceived, when the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are <hi>Preached</hi> or <hi>Read</hi> to them. The Ground of Aſſurance in all theſe caſes is ſtill the ſame; the Difference is onely Gradual. Thoſe who underſtand the <hi>Original Languages</hi> are upon <hi>eaſier</hi> and <hi>nearer</hi> terms of Moral Aſſurance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, but in the other caſes it may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo attained. And in all caſes, God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially afforded means ſufficient to ſecure any reaſonable man about the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of his <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>How can we believe this</hi> Book (ſay ſome) <hi>to be from</hi> God, <hi>when we find contained in it divers</hi> Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? <hi>Several ſtrange and</hi> Incredible Stories? <hi>and other things greatly liable to</hi> Exception?</p>

            <p>This <hi>Objection,</hi> though it looks with the moſt Threatning aſpect, has yet the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Influence; is of all others the moſt Impotent, has the leaſt rational Vigour; and when duely examined, will prove leaſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to thoſe bad Ends for which it is by any intended. When men tell us in general of Contradictions they find in the <hi>Bible,</hi> but come to no Diſtinct and poſitive Proof, they do not in that caſe <hi>Object,</hi> but <hi>Revile.</hi> He that will give an Edge to ſuch kind of Diſcourſe muſt punctually Inſtance <hi>Wherein</hi> this <hi>book</hi> has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted any <hi>One</hi> ſuch thing as implies a direct <hi>Contradiction,</hi> and is in its own Nature utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Impoſſible</hi> to be; or where any two things are affirmed and denyed ſo directly <hi>contrary</hi> to each other, that they are wholly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> This task, with ſome degree of Contempt, we impoſe upon all <hi>Antiſcriptural</hi> men: And are very ſecure that all thoſe <hi>ſeeming Contradictions</hi> that are to be found in the <hi>Bible,</hi> do at laſt prove an eminent Teſtimony to its <hi>Divinity.</hi> For firſt, they are in their <hi>appearance</hi> ſo to be, a great Inſtance that in the Writing of this <hi>Book,</hi> there was no corrupt <hi>Deſign</hi> to <hi>Cajole</hi> or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the opinions of men to it.

            <pb n="433" facs="tcp:63973:225"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They tell us, there are ſome things contained in the Scriptures and aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God, that are altogether <hi>unworthy</hi> of him, and no way fit to proceed from him; and they Inſtance chiefly in two: The <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> given to <hi>Abraham to ſlay his Son,</hi> and the <hi>Command</hi> given to the <hi>Prophet Hoſea, to Marry a Wife of Whoredoms, and an Adultereſs,</hi> The firſt is ſoon Anſwered: For it appears to be a <hi>Command</hi> (which might very properly reſult from the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of <hi>God</hi>) onely for the <hi>Trial</hi> and Exerciſe of <hi>Abrahams obedience;</hi> and 'tis evident, God never intended any ſuch thing ſhould be effected, for he himſelf after forbad it. For the Second, 'Tis very plain to be onely a Tranſaction in a <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion,</hi> to ſet forth the <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous ſtate</hi> of the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> at that time, and nothing that was then really <hi>acted</hi> by the <hi>Prophet</hi> himſelf in perſon; and 'tis uſual in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to have things <hi>hiſtorically</hi> related, that were onely in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſions tranſacted.</hi> So the <hi>Prophet Jeremy,</hi> when he was beſieged in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is ſaid to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go to <hi>Euphrates</hi> a River in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and hide his <hi>Girdle</hi> in the hole of a <hi>Rock</hi> there; 'Twas not poſſible for <hi>Jeremy</hi> at that time to go thither, and 'tis very evident, he did not, neither then nor at any time after: And yet tis Hiſtorically ſet down though it
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:63973:226"/>was a thing only done in a way of <hi>Viſion.</hi> So <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when he was a <hi>Captive</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſeems to be brought to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and is bid to dig <hi>a hole in a Wall there,</hi> and to ſee the <hi>wicked abominations of the Ancients of</hi> Iſrael; and yet 'tis certain, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was then perſonally in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and that whole buſineſs was only done in a <hi>Viſion:</hi> And ſo he himſelf affirms in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>Chapter of his Prophecy.</hi> So the <hi>Prophet Iſaiah's</hi> going <hi>naked twenty days,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiels lying three hundred and ninety dayes</hi> on the one ſide, were things only acted in a way of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They tell us of ſome paſſages in the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> that can by no means be <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled</hi> together. The moſt conſiderable of which are theſe two; Firſt, In <hi>St. Marks Goſpel,</hi> where the time of our <hi>Saviours</hi> death is ſet down, we are told, <hi>That it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</hi> And in <hi>St. Johns Goſpel</hi> and <hi>St. Lukes,</hi> we are told <hi>It was about the ſixth hour.</hi> Both which are eaſily reconciled, by a right underſtanding of the <hi>Jewiſh Cuſtom</hi> of accounting a <hi>Day.</hi> 'Tis well known, the <hi>Jews</hi> divided each day into <hi>four diſtinct parts,</hi> which were their ſeveral hours of publick <hi>Prayer,</hi> and going up to the Temple; the <hi>third hour,</hi> the <hi>ſixth hour,</hi> the <hi>ninth hour,</hi> and the <hi>twelfth hour.</hi> When any one of theſe <hi>hours</hi>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:63973:226"/>came, all the ſpace between that and the other (which was <hi>three hours</hi>) was denominated from that <hi>firſt hour.</hi> As when the <hi>third hour</hi> came, all the whole <hi>three hours</hi> between that and the <hi>ſixth hour,</hi> was called the <hi>third hour:</hi> So that the time of our <hi>Saviours Crucifixion,</hi> being near unto mid-day, or our <hi>Twelve a Clock</hi> but ſome little before it, which was the time they called the <hi>Sixth hour. St. Mark</hi> ſayes he was Crucified the <hi>third hour;</hi> becauſe all the time between the <hi>third hour</hi> and the <hi>ſixth</hi> was ſtrictly ſo called, and yet in regard it was very <hi>near</hi> the <hi>ſixth hour,</hi> both <hi>St. John</hi> and <hi>St. Luke</hi> ſay he was <hi>Crucified about the ſixth hour;</hi> that is, 'Twas very <hi>near</hi> to <hi>Twelve a Clock</hi> at the time of his <hi>Crucifixion.</hi> And ſo there appears not the leaſt ſubſtantial diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them in this matter. Secondly, In the natural <hi>Genealogy</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as 'tis ſet down by <hi>St. Matthew</hi> and <hi>St. Luke,</hi> they ſay, There is great diſagrement, and ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as are not to be reconciled. That there are conſiderable differences we confeſs, and that they are not, without ſome difficulty, to be reconciled, we alſo acknowledge. Firſt, That there ſhould be differences between the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in their accounting of this <hi>Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> is not hard to conceive: If we conſider theſe four things. Firſt, That one <hi>Evangeliſt</hi>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:63973:227"/>begins at the <hi>top,</hi> and traces our <hi>Saviours Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree downward,</hi> The other begins at the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi> and aſcends <hi>upward.</hi> Secondly, One carries up the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> as far as <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom all Mankind were equally exiſting: The other derives him no higher then from the Stock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the <hi>Promiſes</hi> were more peculiarly made. Thirdly, One ſeems to rehearſe chiefly the <hi>Legal</hi> deſcent of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines himſelf more to his <hi>Natural.</hi> Fourthly, One obligeth himſelf in his account to the number of <hi>three fourteens,</hi> and permits himſelf for that Reaſon to leave ſome out, the other without any ſuch confinement, makes his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count more at large. And throughout the whole, they both ſometimes intend the ſame <hi>Perſons</hi> under different <hi>Names.</hi> Theſe things have occaſioned viſible differences and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the manner of ſetting down this <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogy:</hi> Nor can it be otherwiſe, but that theſe differences are ſuch as that they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>irreconcileable,</hi> there is not the leaſt ground to ſuppoſe. Nay, 'tis very reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe from the Nature of them, and from thoſe different Methods we ſee the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> have choſen, that there is a moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Concord</hi> between them, and that this <hi>Genealogy</hi> is after a <hi>various manner</hi> purpoſely
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:63973:227"/>ſet down, to Anſwer divers Objections that might then be made amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in thoſe times: And by that <hi>diverſity</hi> we find in it, is accommodated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to many great and excellent <hi>Ends.</hi> Secondly, That there ſhould by <hi>difficulty</hi> to reconcile the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in this matter, and fully to find out that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Harmony</hi> that we have cauſe to believe there is in the Methods of both, cannot be thought ſtrange, if we conſider theſe two things, Firſt, The <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> (to which theſe Genealogies refer) in reckoning their Genealogies; amongſt them it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to find <hi>differing Pedigrees,</hi> which ſeem much to <hi>contradict</hi> each other, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do not, and great differences were often occaſioned thereby; and this is very eaſie to conceive; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> had many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularites to themſelves and their own Nation in point of <hi>Relation,</hi> which other Countries were not acquainted withall; men of the ſame <hi>Tribe</hi> were upon a <hi>Political</hi> account <hi>Brethren,</hi> as well as thoſe that were <hi>naturally</hi> ſo, and were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſo ſtiled; If a man dyed <hi>Childeſs,</hi> amongſt them, and the next of Kin Marryed his Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and had Children by her, thoſe <hi>Children</hi> are reckoned from <hi>two Fathers.</hi> Legally they were the Children of the <hi>firſt</hi> Husband, and <hi>Naturally</hi> of the <hi>Second. Succeſſors</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:63973:228"/>Inheritors,</hi> both in <hi>Imployments</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> are often reckoned as the <hi>begotten</hi> and <hi>natural Children</hi> of their <hi>Predeceſſors;</hi> and ſo in divers other particular caſes, and in all their Genealogies, they generally reckoned their <hi>deſcents</hi> by a <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>Legal</hi> as well as a <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Line.</hi> Secondly, We now want the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of many <hi>Genealogies</hi> and <hi>Pedigrees</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time, to which, without doubt, the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> much refer in the courſes of their account, and by which (were we poſſeſſed of them) they would much more eaſily have been reconciled and underſtood. The <hi>Jews</hi> were very <hi>curious</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> in the preſervation of things of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and good Reaſon they had ſo to be; for amongſt the <hi>Heathens</hi> want of <hi>Poſterity</hi> might be ſupplied by <hi>Adoption;</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged to a ſtrict ſucceſſion in <hi>Alliance</hi> and <hi>Kindred.</hi> The whole of this matter is moſt judiciouſly diſcourſed of by the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>Annotatious</hi> upon theſe two <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> to which (the exact diſquiſition of all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars being too large a task for this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking) I fear not to refer any impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for a ſufficient Anſwer to all that can be reaſonably objected againſt the <hi>Bible</hi> from hence; there being nothing contained in either of theſe two Genealogies (that of St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:63973:228"/>and that of St. <hi>Luke</hi>) that in the leaſt implies any direct contradiction; nor is there any ſuch difference between them, or between them and any other part of the <hi>Bible</hi> (one of which muſt be punctually made good, or elſe this Objection is of no force) as appears wholly uncapable of any Reconciliation. But on the contrary, 'Tis evident the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an admirable manner conſiſt and agree with themſelves, Although in order to many excellent ends, and to clear us all Doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our <hi>Saviours deſcent,</hi> they <hi>differently</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: Which, upon the forementioned Grounds, can ſeem hard to none to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They tell us There is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Bible,</hi> that ſeems of too <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Low</hi> a nature to come from ſuch a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>Excellent Being</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> and by no means <hi>fit</hi> to be Aſcribed to <hi>Him.</hi> Such are many <hi>Stories,</hi> and many <hi>Similitudes,</hi> and divers <hi>Expreſsions</hi> we find there. On the one hand, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch this <hi>Book</hi> for containing things too <hi>High</hi> to be <hi>Credited:</hi> And on the other hand, they object againſt it, as containing many things too <hi>Mean</hi> to be <hi>Regarded;</hi> In the one, they impeach Gods <hi>Power,</hi> and imply, ſome things are too <hi>Great</hi> for him to <hi>Effect:</hi> And by the other, caſt a contempt upon the higheſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63973:229"/>of his <hi>Condeſcention</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> (for nothing can more Savour of it then ſuch a familiar way of converſing with Men) 'Tis true that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have, by divers <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, Reſemblances,</hi> and <hi>Allegories,</hi> made the whole World and all we converſe with, ſome way or other <hi>Hieroglyphical</hi> to us of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity:</hi> Have expreſſed ſomewhat of <hi>Religion</hi> to us, by all Parts of the <hi>Creation,</hi> and by the moſt common <hi>imployments</hi> of Humane life: Then which, nothing could make <hi>Religion</hi> look with a more <hi>Familiar</hi> aſpect upon us, nor render the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of it more <hi>eaſy</hi> to be <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced</hi> by all <hi>capacities:</hi> Nor is any thing more likely to preſerve the <hi>memory</hi> of things <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> in the minds of men, then when they are expreſſed to them by ſuch things with which they are ſure to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>converſe</hi> while they ſtay in this World. Whatſoever we find in the <hi>Bible</hi> of this Kind, ſtands ſufficiently diſcharged from all Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able exception, becauſe 'tis viſibly but <hi>adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Notions of <hi>Religion</hi> to the <hi>impotency</hi> of many <hi>capacities.</hi> And of the <hi>meaneſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions,</hi> either in <hi>Similitudes, Allegories, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,</hi> or otherwiſe, that we find in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> Theſe two things muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged (by which they are enough ſecured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all juſt and rational Contempt) Firſt,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63973:229"/>That they are ſuch, as in their own nature, are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>apt</hi> to <hi>informe</hi> in all thoſe Caſes in which they are made uſe of. And Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; They all appear to have a direct tendency to inſtruct men in the <hi>Nobleſt</hi> and <hi>Sublimeſt</hi> Truths, And are evidently Conducing to the <hi>Higheſt</hi> and moſt <hi>Excellent Attainments</hi> that Mankind are Capable of.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like Objections have often faced the <hi>Bible;</hi> But have given very little <hi>ſtop</hi> to its <hi>Progreſs.</hi> Indeed, all occaſions given, though by its worſt Enemies, for the <hi>Diſcuſsion</hi> of it, have turn'd greatly to its <hi>Advantage,</hi> and ſtill made it appear leſs capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Solid Exception.</hi> The <hi>Bible</hi> is a Book that will <hi>endure Diſcourſe.</hi> The <hi>Deeper</hi> we ſearch into all parts of it, ſtill the ſurer we are to find a <hi>Divine bottome.</hi> 'Tis true that the <hi>manner</hi> of its <hi>compoſure</hi> is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>end:</hi> Savours altogether of the <hi>wiſdome</hi> of <hi>another world:</hi> 'Tis evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign'd to <hi>ſubvert</hi> all <hi>corrupt Intereſts,</hi> and <hi>debaſe</hi> mens <hi>proud</hi> opinions of their own <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> 'Tis writ after a <hi>ſort</hi> that ſeems <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and in no ſuch <hi>way</hi> as Mankind uſe to <hi>treat</hi> one with another; And therefore, 'tis no wonder if <hi>Some men</hi> both <hi>Object</hi> againſt it and <hi>Reproch</hi> it. Divers things there are which in the Reading of this <hi>Book,</hi> we are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:63973:230"/>obliged to <hi>Conſider,</hi> and by the due conſideration whereof, the Grounds of moſt mens exceptions would be removed. Firſt, the Scriptures appear to be Deſigned as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Store-houſe</hi> of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to all ſorts of <hi>Capacities</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> to the end of the world; And therefore it can be no very eaſie task, upon good Grounds, to condemn any Part, either as <hi>Uſeleſs</hi> or <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Secondly, Many paſſages in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> relate to things <hi>paſt,</hi> and long ſince tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, of the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of which we are not fully informed; And many paſſages were accomodated to things then well known, which we in theſe After-ages are ignorant of. Others relate much to things <hi>future</hi> and to <hi>come:</hi> The Wiſdome and Excellency of which will not ſo fully appear till <hi>Hereafter.</hi> And ſo we ſee it was in the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> The uſe and Reaſon of many things then, could not be ſo fully diſcern'd till explain'd and interpreted by the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> The Book of <hi>Ruth</hi> might then happly have been judged by ſome, as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Addition to the reſt of the <hi>Bible,</hi> But ſince the writing of the <hi>New</hi> we ſee what an excellent uſe there was of it, to make good our <hi>Saviours natural diſcent in the fleſh</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the promiſe. He that ſaw no more then the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> might have thought
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63973:230"/>that Hiſtorical diſcourſe of <hi>Melchiſed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, Many parts of the <hi>Bible</hi> relate to the <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of particular <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Countreys:</hi> Without the knowledg of which, No man can be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge of them. In the Books of <hi>Eſther, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> many things relate to the <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> In the <hi>Prophets,</hi> divers things are not to be underſtood without a reference to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of ſeveral <hi>Countries</hi> to which they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. In the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> many paſſages refer to the Laws and Cuſtomes of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi> And both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> many places are never to be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, without a very exact and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſeveral Cuſtoms and Practices extant in thoſe times amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> This may be ſeen in this one inſtance; Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63973:231"/>He that will receive Him and embrace the Goſpel <hi>muſt forſake father, and mother, houſes and lands, wife, and children, and all he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in this world.</hi> Theſe paſſages of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> in themſelves ſeem ſtrange, and are extreamly hard, at the firſt view, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted or underſtood; But become eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible by a knowledg of the <hi>Jewiſh cuſtoms</hi> at that time; For, 'Twas but the ſame doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine applied to himſelf, that was taught dayly amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in admitting their <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> dealt with all <hi>Strangers</hi> after a Threefold manner: Such as continued in <hi>Gentiliſme</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh Idolatry,</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not to Inhabit amongſt them, nor to have any Place in the Land of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Such as Renounced the Gentile Idolatry and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſome Fundamentals of the <hi>Jewiſh religion,</hi> which they called the <hi>Seven precepts of Noah,</hi> Theſe were termed <hi>Proſelites of the Gate,</hi> had their liberty quietly to Inhabit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and came into the <hi>outer court of the Temple,</hi> which they called <hi>Atrium Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillum.</hi> Such as were <hi>Circumciſed</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the whole of the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> thoſe they called <hi>Proſelites of Juſtice,</hi> And they were in all things taken as <hi>Natural Jews.</hi> The manner of their <hi>initiation</hi> was to be <hi>Waſhed</hi> in ſome great Water up to the <hi>Neck,</hi> and there
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63973:231"/>ſolemnly to Renounce not only their former <hi>Gods</hi> and their former <hi>worſhip,</hi> but their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> all their <hi>Relations,</hi> and <hi>Kindred</hi> whatever, and ſo to come out of the Water as <hi>New borne,</hi> and from the time of that <hi>Ceremony,</hi> to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Legitimate Jews.</hi> Of theſe laſt ſort of Proſelites, and the manner of their becoming ſo, we find mention in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> where, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch as went over to the <hi>Jewiſh Religion, Nec quicquam</hi> (ſays he) <hi>prius imbuuntar, quam contemnere Deos, exuere Patriam, Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Liberos, Fratres vilia habere.</hi> They are taught by their firſt Admiſſion, to deſpiſe (that is, to forſake) their Fathers, and Mothers, Children, and Brethren. And to this Cuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome our <hi>Saviour</hi> evidently referrs, when he ſpeaks of Mens being <hi>Borne again,</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all</hi> to become his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Fourthly, The <hi>Bible</hi> being written at ſeveral <hi>Seaſons,</hi> and in ſeveral diſtinct <hi>Parts,</hi> Revelation aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>gradually</hi> to its <hi>Meridian,</hi> 'Tis not Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ground an exception from any <hi>one part,</hi> without a due conſideration of what we now find in the <hi>Whole.</hi> Many things, in the <hi>Infancy</hi> of <hi>Revelation,</hi> were leſs perfectly made known, ſome practices Leſs condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then what we now find they are under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And thus it was in the caſe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;</hi> For although God had virtually deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined

Firſt, That <hi>Divorce</hi> is Lawful in no <hi>caſe</hi> but that of <hi>Fornication.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that God had eſtabliſhed Marriage, by a Law of <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>firſt inſtitution,</hi> upon thoſe Termes. And although the <hi>Moſaical indulgence,</hi> in regard of the preſent and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> had for ſome time, interpoſed, yet he has plainly told us, It ſhould be ſo <hi>No more,</hi> That Indulgence ſhould be in force no longer, But that the Obligation of <hi>Marriage</hi> ſhould remain as twas from the <hi>Beginning,</hi> That <hi>one Man</hi> and <hi>one Woman</hi> were to become <hi>one Fleſh</hi> in that Relation, and upon no termes to be parted, but in caſe of <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which in its own nature contains a virtual Diſſolution of that Marriage-union.
